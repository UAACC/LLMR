"Good morning, I 'd like to ask some questions about your insurance policies. "
"I am here to help you.
"I bought a house recently and would like to insure it and its content."
The insurance company is trying to determine how much the premiums will be.
"I live in the Oakfield area and paid $ 100,000 for my home."
Oakfield is a low risk area, so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month. The other thing to take into account is deductibles.
"What does that mean exactly?"
"what does it mean if i have a claim and the insurance company pays the first $ 2000 of it?"
None of the above choices.
"What is the difference between a deductible and a co-pay?"

"It can take months.

Han Maimed : What's your plan for the weekend?
I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it. To tell you the truth, I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school. It ’s better to get to know it. What about you?
"What do you do on Saturdays?"
John : I didn 't know you are religious. You just look like a scientific kook, like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory.
Han Maimed : I'm not a scientist, I'm a human being.
"I thought science and religion are not compatible, are they?"
No
" I don 't know if God exists, but I believe in him. "
It's a little complicated. You 'll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U. S. history later on. Religion was and is a part of American people's life. Guess what? Even Harvard University, which is a highly academic institution, is in a sense the product of religion.
"I'm not sure if I'm ready for this..."
"who founded the church?"
The Puritans founded it by the Puritans. Where were the atheistic educators?
"Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans."
They were a religious people.
" Why did the religious separatists flee to other countries?"
"No, they had no freedom of religion.
No
They wanted to help people.
"Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England. They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well."
"Oh, I see. "
"what is the name of the first college?"
1836
In 1639, it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard. Interestingly, JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman.
"It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion."
"Had there not been religion, there would not be Harvard."
"Wow, I didn 't know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history."
"what is the role of religion in harvard history?"
I finally begin to get to know Harvard. It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor. I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard.
"What is Harvard about?"
" I have a lot to learn from you. "

Rick: Hello, Rick. We've got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams, Brazil and China, face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round. Without a doubt, both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match.
The ref signals the start of the game and here we go. Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball. Chen bumps it to the setter, and... a very nice set by Chen!
Xu spikes it! Wow, what a great hit! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in!

I think, maybe, it takes a real Kung fu master to give a more fair assessment ; meanwhile, I am no more than a beginner ; but I really doubt whether kung fu would be of any great help when it comes to defending oneself in real life.
Kung fu was originally intended for self-defense, but with time it became something more than defense skills. Now we are apt to treat it as an art.
The Chinese are really capable of doing things nicely. They even made fighting a great enjoyment, so marvelous and fascinating.
"Jin Yong is a famous Chinese artist.
"I know he is a martial arts fiction writer. But I've read none of his novels."
All of his works have been translated into English. I recommend you to read one or two works of his. You'll get a general glimpse into Chinese kung fu culture. When you go through the pages, you are likely to feel they are not about kung fu alone, but cover all walks of life.
"I see. They must have incorporated a series of Chinese cultural elements."
It is not enough only to be formidable, it also involves a man's character, sense of justice, and values of life.
"Yes, it is a means of self-cultivation, isn't it?"
"I like it a lot.
The network is omnipresent nowadays. It's quite convenient for people. You see, we can download music and information from the Internet ; I can study from it, too. And the most of all, we can compose, send, and receive e-mails.
"Yeah, you are right. Internet makes our lives easier, but it's a two-blade sword."
"What do you mean?"
" Internet brings benefit a lot, but also some disadvantages, for example, many youngsters are addicted to the games and they neglect their study ; or some bad guys steal people's money online, etc."
"I agree, but I think although it has some negative effects, on the whole the Internet does more good to us than harm."
"I really want to switch things up..."
"What were you thinking?"
"I think I want to try a new style."
"What would you like me to do?"
"I want you to cut my hair shorter..."
"How long is the video?"
"what length do i want my hair to be?"
"Yes, I do, but I want it shorter.
"Yes, I've been wanting it short for a while now."
"If you really want me to, then I'll do it."
"I'm absolutely sure that this is what I want."

"I like coffee a lot.
"what is your favorite type of coffee?"
"Yes, I do, but I don't like it.
No, I just buy takeout at Starbucks.
"I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular. Though its taste is not perfect, it's really cheap and convenient."
"What is the name of the coffee you drink? "
Italy
No
No, it is not true.
No doubt about that. For us, coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink. I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee.
No, we don't, especially the old people. But more and more young people fall for coffee.
My mom is 5 footsweet and very nice, and very caring, and very cute, everybody tells her how young she looks, and how she resembles my sister, perhaps. My father is very much completely opposite that. He is a very bi 4, on a good day, 5 foot 2, I think in real life, and she is very nice.

I like slim girls, so I doubt I would find a plump girl attractive.
She's got tiny feet and wears really unfashionable shoes. In fact, she wears unfashionable clothes too.
She is not a person I know.
She's your mother!
I think appearance is very important.

"We have no choices. "
Jack is doing well.
"I'm doing all right?"
"What about a drink?"
"What's the matter, sir?"
"I owe you a lot of money.

Otherwise, if the things we don't want to see happened, we would be responsible and that'll cause you a lot of inconvenience, too."

David: Hi, I am going for an interview tomorrow. It's an American company. Can you give me an idea of what the interviewer will ask?
"Well, they may ask you to tell them more about your educational background and your working background."
"But they can see my resume. It's all in there."
What may happen after you give your viewpoint on why you feel you are qualified for the job?
"What else?"
"What will the company benefit from hiring you?"
"I see. What about the salary?"
They may ask you what kind of salary you have in mind, or simply tell you what the company is offering. I think the latter is more likely for a starting position, especially if you have little experience. And if they are seriously considering hiring you, they will probably want to know when you would be available to start work. And basically, that's about it.

The board of directors is the body that advises the CEO on the company's direction, and the stockholders are the owners of the company.
No, there's a definite difference. You know, the stockholders are the people who own the company... they're the financial control system. Then there's the CEO—the chief executive officer. He's the hot shot, the main guy who is the boss. If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization, everyone knows that the power will go to their head. It's too dangerous. That's the reason for a Board of Directors. The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry. They could be related to the organization, but more commonly, they are independent and non-biased.

"Well, your insurance covers sufficient money to replace it. So you don 't need to worry."
" I don 't think I could afford that kind of car again. I think I 'll have to choose something that is not as hard to replace."

I like sharing my experience and knowledge with them. I think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues.
" How do you know if you are sharing knowledge with others? "
" Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way. For example, it is not sensible at all to argue with the others or correcting someone in front of other people. To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off."
"You are quite right. Thank you for sharing your experience with me. I learned a lot."
" I like it a lot.
I like it. But how did you know about my new job? I wanted to surprise you.
I just heard through the grapevine something about you landing a job with some travel agency down town. You can still fill me in on tile details.

"What else can I do for you?"
"Excuse me, I want to know the price of your CPU."
"Glad to tell you, the price of CPU is 300 dollars."
"It's rather too high. If you can make it cheaper, we will be able to place large orders continuously."
"If you order a large amount, we can give you a discount."
"Well, can you explain it to me?"
The price of CPU is 260 dollars above 1,000 Units.
"Yes, I can reduce more. "
"I'm sorry, but to be frank, considering exploiting the market in your country, we have already supplied you at very low preferential price."
"We have to stop ordering if a reduction can't be made. Please reconsider."
"It is so hard to deal with................................................................................................ 
"We can give you a more reduction, We'd be able to give you an order on the spot."
"What's the matter with you? You look so upset and tired. "

Arden : I need to discuss this with Arden. And in his opinion, we should widen the scope of our ads, so newspaper and Internet should be adopted in this campaign.
"I'm sorry, I can't help you with that."
"We plan to contact www. on-line advertising. com.cn and Shanghai Morning Newspaper to discuss the advertisement schedule."
" I think the idea is very good. In the promotion campaign, two or more media are used together, so as to draw customers'attention and keep hold their attention to larger extent."
"What kind of media do you recommend?"
" I think TV is also an effective media, as long as our company is willing to spend more money on it."
Arden mentioned the paper and on-sales. And I can talk about TV promotion with him later, because TV promotion gets more and more popular among consumers.

"Wow! Just the idea of going back to school fills my head with pain."
"Yes, it has...
"Yeah, I'd have to say it has. But I'm still paying for it, you know."
"I know education is expensive, but it's been my lifelong dream. Call me crazy, but I've always wanted to have that PhD at the end of my name."
"I can't afford that.
"I certainly can't afford it, but I'm sure I could find some good student loans."
"I think you need to separate the dream of having a PhD from the reality of years of more schooling. It's not as romantic as you might think."
"What are you going to do with a Master's or Doctorate? I love language but I don't think there are a lot of well-paying jobs out there for experts on Shakespeare."

I feel overwhelmed by the daily work. Sometimes, I just can 't focus on what I am doing. What is worse, though I make plans for a whole week, I always have to make changes later on because other things come up. I can 't manage my time well. I can 't handle work well. I am afraid I was screw up more things.

"I will. Could you help me with the treadmill? I found it difficult to get the setting right last time."
"Yes, this is my second visit. "
Yes, it is. I'll be coming here regularly. I think I need regular exercise to get in shape and then to stay in shape.

Sis : Why did you ask me to come to this bargain market? It's so crowded and you can 't find anything that you really want.

I am very serious about learning Chinese. But for me the hard part now is pronunciation. You have the four tones in Chinese. It is very hard. Maybe, if you have time, maybe we could do a language exchange.
