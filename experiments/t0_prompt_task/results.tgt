Acme had the lowest price by three cents per hint, but they didn't like your delivery date.
I was able to get a good deal.
They just didn't want to cut the delivery date that close. If something went wrong and you didn't deliver, we might not be able to get stock in time for Christmas.
I was able to get a few things done.
No. It was very close and they argued over the bid for a long time.
I knew the delivery would be slow but I figured the price would win it for me.

You're online eight hours a day.
I like the job though. Sometimes, I help other people in the office if they ’ re having trouble online.
I think it is very useful.
It's fairly useful, but there are two big problems. First, a lot of the information you find online is false. Second, when you buy something online, you don 't see it until you actually get it.
It's a pain.
I am a former student of yours.
I'm Jimmy White.
I am glad to see you again.

Lesley has a television. how do you pick out the sorts of programmes you want to watch?
I try and look at the programmes that are on to decide which particular ones interest me, rather than you turning it on a seven o'clock and you leaving it on until half-past eleven when the programmes finish.
I think it is a great time-waster.
It can just be a sort total amusement for someone and totally consuming without reallyconsidering what it is they're watching.
I think it is important to have a balance between the two.
He will then, you know, hmm. be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things.
In a sense television skilled people's own creativity or their ability entertain themselves because if they're bored all they do is justturn on the television?

A letter of credit is a financial contract between the bank, the bank's customer, and the beneficiary, and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds.
We're agreed on 900.
I'm happy with that price.
We're shaking on it.
I'd like to start by talking about prices.
I'd be glad to answer any questions you may have.
I am not able to afford it.
We are a small company and we are able to offer a very competitive price.
I am looking for a new project.
I am good at writing.
I would like to help with the computer work.
We are going to be working in teams of three.
I like working like that.
We will begin next Monday. Would you be available then?

I am looking for a new job.
I will send the information to you.
Mike, what gives?
It is a new car.
I like the wheels.
It's a good idea.
It's out of this world.
It is special, isn't it?
They sold you for a lot.
I'll have to moonlight for the next two years.
I can imagine.
It is a great game.
I'd love to.
Tom: I'm trying to find a place to stay.
Sure.
The cork seems to be stuck.
I must go
I swear it, and the oath shall be kept.
I must go!

I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere now.
I ask you to pass through life at my side-to be my second self and best earthly companion.
I stayed at home and played video games by myself. It was really fun!
I guess I'm a bit of a nerd.
I'm really into video games. In fact, all my friends are on the Internet. I've never met any of them in the real world.
I'd like to invite you for dinner tonight. Do you think you'll have time?
I'm free tonight.
Western food
I prefer seafood.
I will pick you up at your hotel at 5:30 p. m.
I'll be waiting for you.
The cafeteria is closed today.
They are remodeling.
We could go there for lunch today.
Peter : I hope you are in a better mood than you were this morning.
I was a grouch.
The air conditioning is not working!
Dan is on top of that. I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up.
They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring. The circuit breakers keep going out all the time. It ’s really annoying!
The gutters outside were clogged and that ’s why the parking lot was flooded.
I am going to have to buy a new one.
Everything in that minibar has been consumed, sir?
Everything's gone.
I would like to have a teddy bear.
I'm a big fan of Jim Beam.
None of the above choices.

Is that it for now?
I am a big fan of the show.
It would be a great way to decorate our room.
I think we can have a try.
The tapestry is the highest form of expression of the rug weaving art, an exquisite handicraft of superb artistry in typical Chinese style.
No, it is the magnificent landscape in Guiling.
I think it is.
The linen one, the figured dacron or the brocade?
I'd like to pay my bill now.
The name and room number, please?
Tom Wilson in Room 306.
I have used the hotel gym.
No.
You have stayed for four nights at 90 US dollars each, and here are the meals that you had at the hotel. That makes a total of 660 US dollars.

I need many things.
I can get a few of them right away, but might have to order some.

We will order and let you know when the supplies are here.

I 'd like to ask some questions about your insurance policies.
I can help you with your computer.
Is it possible to insure a house and its contents?
We live in a rural area.
I live in the Oakfield area and paid $ 100,000 for my home.
Oakfield is a low risk area, so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month. The other thing to take into account is deductibles.
The minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000.
The first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you. The insurance policy covers any amount above that, up to the agreed limit.
None of the above choices.
If you have higher deductibles, your premiums are lower, because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less.
I presume that the insurance period can be for as long as we agree.
We initially sign one-year policies with our policyholders. These are renewable after the first year.
It can take months.

I was good at the long jump. I liked the sprints best.
I have won a few.
I was a regional champion for the 100 and 200 meters. I usually did well in the dong jump competitions, but I couldn 't compete with kids from other schools in the javelin.

They aren't able to get a job.
They are slanting.
I can do it perfectly.
It costs about $.
I can make them as new as before.

I 'll repair them for you.
I will need to wait a few days.
They will be ready in a few minutes.

I am going to go to the beach.
I want to go to Harvard.
I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays.
I didn 't know you are religious. You just look like a scientific kook, like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory.
A lot of Americans, including many scientists, believe in religion.
I thought science and religion are not compatible, are they?
The U. S. is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world.
They believe in a higher power.
It is a part of American people's life.
I am a fan of the show.
It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England.
They were atheists.
Puritans were the first group of English settlers to arrive in the United States.
They were a religious group.
They fled to other countries to escape persecution.
They were forced to live in a church.
It was these Puritans who founded Harvard College.
They wanted to help people.
Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England. They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well.
I see.
Harvard University
It was founded in 1636 by a group of Puritan settlers.
Harvard University
Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion.
Harvard would not exist if there was no religion.
It was a surprise to me.
Harvard University has been a place of worship for generations of students and faculty. But the university's history is also marked by a strong religious tradition.

I finally begin to get to know Harvard. It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor. I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard.
Harvard is a part of the United States. So you have to know the U. S. history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard. The two are closely related.
I have a lot to learn from you.

You can pay by mail, telegraphic or SWIFT transfer. Or you can have a banker's draft and mail it yourself to the beneficiary.

I think, maybe, it takes a real Kung fu master to give a more fair assessment ; meanwhile, I am no more than a beginner. But I really doubt whether kung fu would be of any great help when it comes to defending oneself in real life.
It was originally intended for self-defense, but with time it became something more than defense skills. Now we are apt to treat it as an art.
They are really capable of doing things nicely. They even made fighting a great enjoyment, so marvelous and fascinating.

It is not enough only to be formidable, it also involves a man's character, sense of justice, and values of life.
It is a way of life.
It is a good network.
It is omnipresent nowadays. I can download music and information from the Internet ; I can study from it, too. And the most of all, we can compose, send, and receive e-mails.
It makes our lives easier, but it also makes us more vulnerable.
I mean a symphony orchestra.

Sit straight, but not stiff, against the back of the chair.
Yes.
I like the food here.
I'm a newspaper columnist. I write comments for a living. I enjoy working in a coffeehouse.
It is a bit too noisy.
I like the circumstances, as I can see a variety of people here, who can always give me tremendous inspiration. And the most important thing is coffee as it is my life.
I like a cup of coffee with a little bit of cream.
I can drink any other. I'm not particular on it.
I would.
I don't make coffee very often. Making coffee is a bit troublesome. Most of the time, I just buy takeout at Starbucks. And also, I quite like instant coffee.
I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular. Though its taste is not perfect, it's really cheap and convenient.
It is the most popular coffee in the world.
The United States
I love Irish coffee. It's hard to say. Just depends on your taste.
I agree. I heard in the western countries, almost everyone likes coffee. Is that true?
They drink tea.
We don't, especially the old people. But more and more young people fall for coffee.
My mom is 5 footsweet and very nice, and very caring, and very cute, everybody tells her how young she looks, and how she resembles my sister, perhaps. My father is very much completely opposite that. He is a very bi 4, on a good day, 5 foot 2, I think in real life, and she is very nice.

We're going to switch to a new production control program on Monday. The old and the new programs will operate in tandem for four to six weeks. That should give us time to iron out any little problems.
We're very busy at the moment and certainly don't want any problems at this time of year.
I am fine.
I'm having a little trouble with this form.
The problem is that the narrator is narrating.
I want to buy a L / C.
There are two types of wills : revocable and irrevocable.
I should choose that one.
I would recommend it, yes.
No, it is not.

I make a mean potato salad!
We are not a fan of potato salad.

I plan to take the loan for 3 years.
I'm sure you are qualified to apply for this loan.
The loan is repaid over a period of time.
The principal and interest on a loan are paid on a monthly basis.
Is that correct?
You are permitted to effect an early payment in part or in full with the consent of our bank.
I am very grateful.

It was a great night.
I'm glad I could help.
I included a little extra for you.
I didn't have to do that!
They're great for camping!

I think there is nothing.
I have a lot of fresh food, live plants, or animals.
None of that.
The passports are in the suitcase.
I am free tonight.
I don't eat any kind of meat.
I decided to become vegetarian because I wanted to eat less meat.
I saw a program a few months ago about how animals are raised for human consumption. I haven't been able to eat a single piece of meat since.
I do.
I've also been buying organic fruit and vegetables, which is more expensive, but much better for you because they don't have any pesticides on them.
I have a newfound love for health.
I eat fruit and vegetables.
I eat a lot of meat.
I eat a lot more tofu, beans, nuts and some fish.

I like listening to rock music.
I like music that has a fast beat and is lively, like dance music. You prefer classical music, don ’ t t?
I find it very relaxing. I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work.
I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music. It ’ s certainly more sophisticated than modern dance music.
Classical music is supposed to be good for your brain. Research suggest that it makes your brain more active. Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better.
I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress.
I usually play it as background music while I'm cooking or doing other housework.
I've got a few classical music CD's. I should follow your lead and increase my brain power.
You can find plenty of recording on the internet too. You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them.
You might find something you like. Classical music might make you clever, but dance might make you livelier and happier.

Andy is finding it difficult.
I like my colleagues.
They are teaching me how to play the guitar.
I work in the marketing department. The corporate culture is totally different from my last employer. Before, when I was assigned a task, I was totally on my own but here most of the work is done by others.
It's very important to feel like you are part of the team at work.
I like my new boss. He is easy to get along with treats everybody with respect and appreciation. He's highly respected by all his employees.
I wish my boss was like that.
He was extremely controlling and overbearing.
I'm a bit jealous.
The company decided to cancel your trip to Hong Kong.
I am not going to risk it.
It is a good thing.

It would be dated.
I am going to celebrate my birthday with you all in a night club this year, what do you say?
I enjoy clubbing, especially those clubs with live bands. The only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad, full of smoke, and the music is too loud, so conversations are not really possible. Once I nearly got burnt by a cigarette.

Todd: Hi Linda, this is Todd.
Todd, good to hear from you!
I just wanted to tell you what a great time I had with you at the movies last week.
I love the movie.
I also enjoyed it and was wondering if you would like to go for a hike in the mountains with me on Saturday.
I would love to join you on a hike. Could I maybe bring a picnic lunch for us to eat on the trail?
Linda, that is a great suggestion.
We are leaving at 8:00.
We could get started before the heat gets too bad.
I was trying to get out of the car.
You are a risk to others.
I ran a red light.
I did.
I apologize, but I didn't realize that I did.
The yellow means slow down, not speed up.
I did learn that.
I was trying to get to the gym.

No, it is in a separate bag.
I know you.
I'm not sure. You look familiar.
You are Mr.Stevenson, right?
It's a new car, but it's totaled.
It is covered by your insurance.
I don 't think I could afford that kind of car again. I think I 'll have to choose something that is not as hard to replace.
The insurance company should not charge you more.
I would have to pay more for the car.
No, I would not want full coverage.
Sir, here is your curried beef.
I am afraid you have made a mistake. It's not the dish I ordered.
It's for table 11.
I am reading a book.
Death on the Nile
I haven't read it yet, but I saw the movie.Could I borrow it when you finish reading?
The receipt is not required.
I left it home.
We can't do anything without the receipt.
I'll go to get it. How late will you be open?
I am very popular with people around me.
I like sharing my experience and knowledge with them.
It is very settled and some second stances. People may think you are telling them how to do their work. If they take it personally, they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work.
It is not sensible at all to argue with the others or correcting someone in front of other people. To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off.
I am glad I could help you.
I like it.
I wanted to surprise you.
I just heard through the grapevine something about you landing a job with some travel agency down town. You can still fill me in on tile details.
I was a little nervous about applying for a job at Ace Travel Agency.

More than enough.

It's really tough.
It is the most difficult period of my family have experienced.
I am a student.
I have found a part-time job.
I will always be there.
We are going to start with the basics.
a spokesman for the british embassy in london said tuesday that the british government was 'not a fan of the british embassy' and that it was 'not a fan of the british embassy'.
We should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion, so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product, L-series.
I think it is a difficult task.
I know that. I need to discuss this with Arden. And in his opinion, we should widen the scope of our ads, so newspaper and Internet should be adopted in this campaign.
It is a small, slender, rounded, spherical, spherical, spherical, spherical, spherical, spherical, spherical, spherical, spherical, spherical, spherical, spherical, spherical, spherical, spherical, spherical, spherical, spherical, spherical, spherical, spherical, spherical, spherical, spherical 
We plan to contact www. on-line advertising. com.cn and Shanghai Morning Newspaper to discuss the advertisement schedule.
The idea is very good. In the promotion campaign, two or more media are used together, so as to draw customers'attention and keep hold their attention to larger extent.
I recommend a DVD.
I think TV is also an effective media, as long as our company is willing to spend more money on it.
Arden just mentioned the paper and the on-sales. And I can talk about TV with him later, because TV promotion gets more and more popular among consumers.
I feel so uncomfortable.
I am sick.
The teacher is dragging the chalk over the blackboard. It set my teeth on edge.
Mary, your tenant up in Lincoln Park.
Mary : I need to buy a new car.
I was wondering when trash collection day was.
It's on Tuesdays and Fridays.
Great.
It's a good idea to call ahead and make sure they can take it.
It's in the kitchen.
It's at the corner of that street.
I call the city.
The company'll send a guy out next month to give you the bill.
All right. Thanks a lot.

I'm going over to WebTracker, too.
We will still be together!
I'm already working for WebTracker. Vince never wanted to give me what I was worth, so I figured, what the heck.
I can't believe this.
You're all set now?
I am so happy to hear that.
It was nothing.
I really appreciated it.
I was happy to help.
It was so kind of you.
It's not a problem.
I want to rent this apartment.
I'm glad to hear that.
I am asking for a few hundred dollars.
You will have to pay $ 1050 every month.
I can 't afford that.
I can afford it.
I was thinking $ 800 a month.
I 'll need you to pay more than that.
It is a lot.
It's a lot of money.
I can live with that.
We are allowed to wear casual clothes in the office.
The company rules are not very strict at this point.
I am glad that you like it.
There are some forbidden activities.
They are a neophyte.
Don't use office phones for personal matters.
I got it.
None of the above choices.
I will return it.

Shirley will join me for lunch.
It is a great place to visit.
I am looking for a new job.
It's OK... as long as you're buying!

I'd love to help if I can.
I have a Bachelor's degree in English literature.
I am so scared.
I have a Master's degree... hasn't that helped my career?
I 'd have to say it has. But I'm still paying for it, you know.
I know education is expensive, but it's been my lifelong dream. Call me crazy, but I've always wanted to have that PhD at the end of my name.
Is it worth it?
I certainly can't afford it, but I'm sure I could find some good student loans.
I think you need to separate the dream of having a PhD from the reality of years of more schooling. It's not as romantic as you might think.
I love language but I don't think there are a lot of well-paying jobs out there for experts on Shakespeare.
I'm scared.
It's just raining cats and dogs.
It's raining outside.
It's just windy and raining outside.
I feel really down.
I'm a nanny.
I am sorry for the inconvenience.
I am a fan of the tv show.
I can 't manage my time well. I can 't handle work well. I am afraid I was screw up more things.

It's pretty advanced.
I'll quickly send a short message to my wife and take the elevator down to the basement.
Is that where you park?
Is my car safe in the car park?
It is in the mail.
I have keyless entry, and the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car. Now, we can look at the navigation system to find the best route home.
It even shows all the roads that are congested at the moment.
I can rely on this to direct me home. Now I just need to find my E-Card to automatically open the gate and we can drive out.

No, they can only be cashed after the maturity date.
They can be bought and sold by anyone. They also can be cashed on maturity in any nationwide financial institution.

Technically, yes.

I found it difficult to get the setting right last time.
No, it is my second visit.
I think I need regular exercise to get in shape and then to stay in shape.
The treadmill is excellent for helping you to build up stamina. Each time you use it, increase this distance. don't worry about your speed at first. You can increase that later.
I was told that the first time I came heer. I was told not to put too much pressure on my body at first. I need to build up slowly.
I am looking for a job.
I am looking for a room for a few days.

They are two different sports.
In football, only the goalkeeper can use his hands. In rugby, the ball is usually carried forward by players, though kicking is permitted.
They throw it to each other.
They can only pass the ball backwards.
It is a game of skill.
A goal is scored when the ball is carried over the goal line.
There's a lot more physical contact in rugby, isn 't there?
Players usually need to bring a player down to stop him from moving forward with the ball. This is called  tackling '', as in football.
The ball is a different shape in rugby, isn 't it?
It's not perfectly round like a football. A rugby ball is oval in shape. There's a match on TV this afternoon. Why don 't you watch it with me? I 'll try to explain the rules and tactics while we're watching.

It's different.
We can see the world in a different way.
They have different restaurants and different kinds of architecture.
I will enjoy it.
We have a few left.
We can go on a lot of different rides if you like.
I was only interested in the Haunted House and the roller coaster rides. The other rides are for kids.
It is up this pathway here.
I'm afraid I can 't make it to dinner tomorrow night.
I'm a fan of the show.
I'm not feeling well.
I'm sorry to hear that. Hey, don 't worry about the dinner. We 'll do it some other time. But you take care of yourself.
They have a new home.
He's really lucky. It seems that he could win the bet at every turn.
