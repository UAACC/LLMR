The insurance company is offering a home insurance policy.
"I live in the Oakfield area and paid $ 100,000 for my home. "
Oakfield is a low risk area, so your premiums will probably be around $ 100. The other thing to take into account is the deductibles."
"What does that mean exactly?"
"What does it mean if I have a claim? "
The deductible is higher.
"If you have higher deductibles, your premium are lower. because you will pay more of the claim and we will - pay less."
"It seems that I should do some calculations before deciding. I presume that the insurance period can be for as long as we agree."
"We initially sign one-year policies with our policyholders. These are renewable after the first year."
"It can take months.

"Well, they may ask you to tell them more about your educational background and your working background."

"They may want to know how the company will benefit and why they should hire you?"
"I see. What about the salary?"
They may ask you what kind of salary you have in mind, or simply tell you how much the company is offering. I think the latter is more likely for a starting position ; especially if you aren't very experienced - and they will probably want to know when you would be available to start work :)

"I'm sorry, I can't help you."
"We plan to contact www. on-line advertising com.cn and Shanghai Morning Newspaper to discuss the advertisement schedule."
" I think the idea is very good. In the promotion campaign, two or more media are used together ; so as to draw customers'attention and keep hold their attention to larger extent."
"What kind of media do you recommend?"
" I think TV is also an effective media, as long as our company is willing to spend more money on it."
