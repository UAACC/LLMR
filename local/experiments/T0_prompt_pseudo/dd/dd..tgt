IBA, how can I help?
My friend also has an account with you and also enjoys shopping on the Internet. She recommended I sign up for this service too.
"That was a wise decision, if I may say so. Our Personal Internet Banking Service offers online shopping transactions, payment of household bills online, account management..."
I will probably just use it for online shopping. At the moment, I have to meet the seller in person and pay cash, if it's a local seller.
No, I fed them today.
Yes, I have.
"That's good! Just make sure to bathe them later."
No problem. I can do that for you.
"Thank you! They have to go to the vet on Saturday?"
I know. What time do they go?
"Their appointment is at eleven o'clock in the morning."
"Nice to meet you here. How come you dropped into this company today?"
"I've been working here for a year and a half."
"Two years or so. "
The narrator works the night shift.
No, in most cases I don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with.
No, I don't like it.
"It is hard to say.But I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant. Sometimes, I am really under great pressure when it gets busy."
Take it easy. I'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant. I hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job.
"The silent I meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss."
I'm Mark Rancor.
Nice to meet you.
May I know your name, please?
I'm Rose Teller. I think I've seen you somewhere before?
"Yes, I remember now. Were you Mr. John's dinner partner last month?"
No, I work for 3M, right?
I did, but now I'm for Microsoft. How are things with you?
" Good....."
May I know what you do?
I'm a fashion designer. Next month, I have a fashion show. I can get you a couple of tickets. So you can bring a friend if you like.
"Sure. That would be great. Good luck."
Jim : Look, Jim. That man just fell down over there.
"We better see if he's OK..."
Sir, are you all right?
He's not answering. You 'd better check his pulse and breathing.
He's not breathing, and there's no pulse. Call 911.
"I'm going crazy. "
"What's the matter?"
"I've got a dozen things to do and they all have to be done immediately. "
So how did I do?
Not too good, I'm sorry.
I lost my wallet.
"It was close. To be honest, you had the lowest price by three cents per hint, but they didn't like your delivery date. Acme promised them almost a full month sooner."
The price was good.
"Yes, they loved the price, the delivery date was the problem. They just didn't want to cut the delivery date that close. If something went wrong and you didn't deliver, we might not be able to get stock in time for Christmas. If you could have been two or three weeks faster on delivery, they might have gone with you."
"So I didn't miss by much then. "
No, it was very close and they argued over the bid for a long time.
"I knew the delivery was slow but I figured the price would win it for me."
"Yes, I can assist you in any way.
"Yes, please. What I need is to handle some domestic affairs."
"Oh, I see. In what area?"
Well, I need a Deposit Certification to handle this.
No, I don't have a passport.
No, there is no handling fee.
The train is about to leave.
"Excuse me. I want to pay for these items. "
"OK. This way, please."
"How much is it all together?"
Let me see. 100 dollars.
no
"Sorry. You can only pay in cash."
Here you are.
"Yes, I need the invoice."
"Yes, and can you pack the things up, please?"
"How often do you use the internet?"
I use it almost every day, but I usually only use it to check my email. I don ’ t often surf the net.
Yes, I use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company.
So, you're online eight hours a day.
Yes, I like the job though, sometimes I help other people in the office if they're having trouble online.
The internet is very useful.
It's fairly useful, but there are two big problems. First, a lot of the information you find online is false. Second, when you buy something online, you don 't see it until you actually get it.
"What do you do when you're buying something online? "
Joe Brown: file_photo>
"Yes, of course. I'm Jimmy White."
"Nice to see you again."
I called about that ad we saw in the paper.
"What is the bank manager's name?"
"That's the one. "
"What happened?"
"You were right, it was from a headhunter. He wouldn't tell me anything without a signed contract."
"Well, no surprise there. "
No! Not at all. But I did find out they have more than one position with different clients so at least one would probably work out.
The narrator will sign a contract with them.
I'm going there tomorrow.
" Good luck. "
" And I think I 'll look in on a few other Employment Agencies while I'm downtown, to see what they have."
" I am very proud of John. "
No one has expected him to really get somewhere with his business.
No, I don't mind helping you.
"What can I do for you?"
I'm not sure how to find my next class.
The dialogue response of "Do you know what building that it's in?" is:
The C building, I think.
Well, that's not far away.
"Yes, I'd be happy to point you in that direction."
No, I don't know the room number.
"It's C261."
My next class is around there.
"Yes, I can show it to you "
"That China-gown of Tang-Dynasty style is so beautiful. Would you show it to me, please?"
"Absolutely. Here it is."
"Yes, I'd like to try it on."
"Please do, the fitting-room is over there."
It feels a little tight around the waist.
I'm sorry, we don't have this color in your size. We have some green ones in your size. Would you please have a look at this green one?
"OK. How much does it cost?"
No, I'm fine.
"Yeah. Why not?"
Because... I heard John got married yesterday.
The narrator went to the wedding.
No, he didn't tell me about it.
Kata : You've got a beautiful singing voice. You hit the high notes perfectly.
I think you are destined to be a singer. You have the best voice!
Yes, I would like to sing with you.
"Yes, I'd like to. It's my honor. Let's pick a song."
"How about this one?"
"Sorry, I can't sing the song."
"Er... How about this one?"
The dialogue response of " OK. But I'm not familiar. I don't know the beginning part." is :
"Never mind. I'll sing the first part."
The summer vacation is coming. Have you any plans?
I haven't made up my mind. Maybe I will go to the US. What about you?
I am going on a hiking trip. It's good exercise as well as fun.
" I think so. "
Lee will come as well.
"Good evening. "
"Good evening. Could you let us have a double room?"
The narrator will be staying for a few days.
A week or ten days. We'd like to have a quiet room, if possible-not too near the street.
Let me see. Yes, you can have Room 313. It's at the back.
no
"how much weight do i gain in a day?"
" All right, we'll take it."
Sir, will you register, please?
" OK. "
Lesley got a television. how do you pick out the sorts of programmes you want to watch?
I try and look at the programmes that are on to decide which particular ones interest me, rather than you turning it on a seven o'clock and you leaving it on until half-past eleven when the programmes finish.
Yes, it is a great time-waster.
"Un... I think it can be a time-waster and it depends on how particular people are about what they want to see... Mm, it can just be a sort total amusement for someone and totally consuming without reallyconsidering what it is they're watching."
"How do you prevent it coming into your life and taking oversour evenings and at the same time perhaps get out of the television some of the sort of best things... best programmes that... that undoubtedly are on television?"
"Well, I suppose one of the problems is... will depend on what a person's life style is, and that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television, he will then, you know, hmm. be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things."
No, I think it is a waste of time.
The narrator is looking for something.
"I want to see you play. Be quick!"
No, we do not take reservations.
"Of course, reservations aren't necessary, but we recommend them as our restaurant can get quite busy."
"I need a table for two for tonight. "
"What time is it now?"
"We'd like to be seated at 8 p m. "
None of the above choices.
Non-smoking.
The reservation is under the name .
Paul: Hi, my name is Paul. Paul: Hi, my name is Paul. Paul: Hi, my name is Paul. Paul: Hi, my name is Paul. Paul: Hi, my name is Paul.
Quite a few times, I had my back to the wall.
Generally they will turn out to be a good thing.
"That's right. "
Waffles
"I usually have cereal for breakfast. "
"No, it's served with hot milk."
"Yeah. Cold milk wakes me up."
Chinese people don't like to eat cold food.
No, it is not.
"But I'm open to new things. I'll have a bowl of cereal, too."
"With hot milk?"
He doesn't know the first thing about coffee.
True, I always see him drinking instant.
"Let's take him some of Kitty's best and make the pitch again."
No, I don't think so.
Bob: Did you hear about Bob and Mary? Mary: Yes, I did.
No, what happened?
"They had an argument and split up."
"What would you like?"
"We'd like to have western food today. Could you tell us something about it?"
The first food you have is appetizer, followed by a soup, then you will have the main course. The last dishes are desserts.
None of the above choices.
The narrator is ready to start the invitation to tender.
The tender will be opened at 8:00 a.m..
"We intend to open the tender at first next month in Beijing."
"And when is the closing date?"
The time period is set on June 29th.
"What is the tender for?"
The area of the factory buildings is around 8,000 square meters. You can read the details in the invitations which will be sent tomorrow.
"Thank you for your information. "
"You're welcome. "
"I'm sorry to have taken up too much of your time. "
"It doesn't matter. We'll be in touch."
"Great! I landed on Classic Movies."
" I didn't know you liked old movies. "
" I love them, especially the all-time greats like Gone With the Wind. "
" Today's movies are just too commercial!"
The narrator is looking for a job.
" I still have no idea what to do now. "
The narrator is trying to get the narrator to calm down.
"I could not agree with you more. But I feel worried about what to do next as soon as I begin to write my resume. "
There is no need to do like this, we can surf the net and find some templates for resume.
" OK! Let's put our heads together. "
" You said it. We can also find some helpful advice from some experts. "
"Hello. Holiday Inn. How can I help you?"
Yes, I booked a single room in your hotel for this Friday. But I'm sorry to say that I have to cancel it. My wife is very sick now. I don 't think she 'll be able to travel by this Friday.
" Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. "
Yes, you can cancel your reservation.
Certainly. May I have your name, please?
Tom Smith: Hi, my name is Tom Smith.
"Okay. I have canceled your reservation, Mr. Smith."
"Thank you very much. "
" You should save some money on parking here. "
" Yeah, I don 't have to pay for a space on the street. "
It took me a while to find a spot yesterday.
"Well, last night it took me half an hour to find a spot when I came home from work."
" I get home late, don 't I?"
The dialogue response of "Yeah, around seven, most of the street parking is gone by then." is:
" Ah, well. You can 't have everything. "
"I haven't figured out where I want to transfer to yet."
I can 't think of where to go.
"where would you like to go to school?"
I really don 't know.
" I can 't think of anything. "
" I really like where I'm at now. "
The narrator is looking for a job.
"That may be what I'm going to do."
It's a perfectly good school.
" You're absolutely right. "
"I'm going to take a nap. "
" Titanic is so cheesy. "
It's romantic. When it first came out, I saw it in the theaters five times in one week.
"Really? Well the special effects might have been good in 1997, but when you watch it today they make the film seem really cheesy."
No, it is not fun to go to a cheap flick once in a while.
"Actually, I have to admit that you're right. I like some pretty cheesy movies too. I love Arnold Schwarzenegger action flicks, especially " Terminator. "
No, I didn't watch it over and over again.
"Thank you for joining us this evening at Chez Attitude. "
"I am Mr. Foster, and we have a 7:00 dinner reservation tonight for four people."
"Welcome, Mr. Foster, if you would have a seat in the lounge area our hostess will be ready to seat you in just a moment."
"We are going to have a drink while we are waiting. Please let the hostess know that she can find us there."
She will come and let you know when your table is prepared.
No, they are not new.
An outside table is available right now if you would like to be seated immediately.
The narrator would like to sit outside.
"Here is your table, and now may I take your drink order while you are considering what to have for dinner?"
Yes, please bring us a pitcher of margaritas and four glasses while we are figuring out our dinner order.
"I'll put your drink order in and be right back to get your dinner order."
My toothache started nearly a month ago. The pain's been keeping me awake. Would you please have a look?
Open your mouth, please.
The one right at the back.
"I'm afraid we can 't save that one. It will have to come out."
No, it will not hurt much.
"I'll give you an injection, then you won't feel pain."
"Want to send out for some Chinese?"
"Something is wrong with my car..."
I'm hungry, and there's a take-out restaurant near here. We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat.
No, I ’d rather go out. The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home. Maybe we can try some other food today... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day, the one over in the shopping center?
Al's Steakhouse.
"Yes, that is the place that serves such large portions of meat."
Yes, their steaks are enormous. Sometimes I can 't finish what I've ordered.
I hate to let food go to waste.
"Excuse me. I have booked one ticket on BN118 for tomorrow.But now I've changed my plan.Can you help me refund the ticket?"
"Sure..."
"Here is the ticket. "
"What's up? You look depressed."

I took a lot of courses, such as Philosophy, Logic, Ethics, Aesthetics, etc.

She's a lot like me.
" Thanks a million. "
Our house is too small. We had better have a big one.
"It's not a question of if, but when.
I heard it's a posh store that's only got branches in big cities.
" I love this store. The only problem is that it's extremely expensive. "
I've decided that for your birthday I'm going to take you shopping for a new dress.
I thought you hated shopping.
I do, that's why you should appreciate this gift!
" Let's go in and try some things on. "
I think this red dress would really suit you.
No, they don't have it in size 8.
On any other day, it would cost me a fortune, but it ’s on special offer today.
No, they don 't.
Let me look... they've got one in blue, green, pink, black... and white. Here you are.
This is perfect!
Happy Birthday!

This cloakroom is open until 10 p. m.
I will be back about 11:30 tonight.
"We will transfer your bag to the Lobby Floor Cloakroom. You may collect it there, madam."
" I see. Thanks a lot. "
"What can I do for you this afternoon?"
"I want to take out some money, but there's a massive queue for the ATM so I thought I'd do it over the counter."
"Unfortunately, an ATM is being refilled because it ran out of money. That's what's causing the hold up."
" Oh, I see. I thought maybe it was just the time of the day, although it isn't usually busy at 2:30 in the afternoon."
"You are right, you have just missed the lunchtime rush. Could you fill out a withdrawal slip, please?"
"I did that already, while I was waiting. Also, here's my card."
"Thank you. And you require..."
800 RIB, please.
"Please enter your personal code right here, on the key pad. And sign here, please."

No problem, you're welcome.
"I will be glad to do the same for you when you're sick. "
John, do you have a minute?
Leo: Hi, Leo. Sure, what's up?
" I've been meaning to talk to you about the situation in the office. "
I'm not in there very often, it's so noisy that I can 't work.
The dialogue response of " That's exactly what I'm getting at. We're supposed to be able to do our preparation and marking in that office, but have you noticed? Jack constantly has students coming in and out.
He hasn't spoken to anyone about it.
No, not yet, but someone ’s going to have to.
No, we can 't really ask him to stop coming in for help, can we?
No, of course not. But I ’ m not able to do my work and neither are you.
The narrator suggests recommending him to use the storage room down the hall.
" Oh, that would be too small. "
With the cabinets taken out, it might be bigger than it looks.
Come to think of it, you may be on to something. Let's go have a look.
" Hello! I'd like to get busy on my computer, but I need some broadband."
There is an Ethernet cable in your room. Just plug it into the back of your laptop.
Uh-oh! I can't use Ethernet. My computer is wireless only.
"That's okay. I can tell you about some alternatives we have."
Any alternative that works will be great.
There is a computer lab on the first floor.
"What's the charge for this?"
The lab and the computers are free, but you have to pay for whatever you print.
The narrator is looking for alternatives.
"Of course. Our lobby is set up for wireless, so just bring your computer down here."
I can use my laptop in the lobby if I need to print something.

"Home at last. Tonight we have a lot of homework though."
Jane: Are you saying we don 't have time to watch our favorite show tonight? Jane: You know I really don 't like our teacher all that much. He gives far too much homework. He criticizes me in front of everyone all the time.
He's kind of boring and not very active. He always looks unhappy too.
"Yes, and he also..."
No, I don't think so.
Probably not. After all he is our teacher. We should try to find something nice to say.
It's getting dark. We should finish our homework now.
Belinda, I'm going to a party tonight. What shall I wear?
informal
"I guess it's formal. "
"Then, you should dress well. "
"That's right. "
" I think a white shirt with a blue tie looks nice on you. "
" You are smart. "
" Of course, the sports shoes don 't go with the formal occasions. "
None of the above choices.
The brown leather shoes go well with your trousers.
The narrator will pick up the narrator after the party.
It 'll be too late ; you 'd better take a taxi.
Mr. Tang, we have decided to hire you. How much do you expect to get a month?
I should not, of course, make a change for less. Could you provide me with a monthly salary of four thousand yuan?
I don 't think we can give you that much as the starting salary.
" Nowadays this starting salary is not high based on my skills and experience. "
"Maybe, but there are many fringe benefits here."
"What are they?"
"Additional to medical benefits, we also offer a rent free house and the use of a car."

We haven't decided yet. There are a lot of things to sort out, you know.
No, we are having a small wedding.
"Yes, I've always dreamed of having a big wedding. "
"I don't know what to say about that."
I don't really enjoy big occasions, but I think I 'll come round to the idea in the end, It only happens once in a lifetime.
"Bonjour!"
"What's the matter with you?"
"I said, Bonjour!"
Ted: What's wrong with you, Ted?
I'm speaking French. Don 't you know anything?
None of the above choices.
I just got back from my language school. We have to speak French all day there. No English allowed!
"What are you doing that for?"
I'm trying to learn new skills. It makes me more qualified for a good job.
Hey, could you help me try and figure out how to get ready for my job interview?
The most important thing to do is to make sure you know the company and what services or products it provides.
Yes, I pretty much understand the company.
"Well, after you've done your research, you have to decide whether the company is casual or formal. Have you decided what they are yet?"
"Yes, I've been observing them. "
The narrator has chosen what to wear.
"I already have something to wear."
I would always be ready to go shopping with you! Should we talk about other basics?
OK, I am ready to think of other things.
"Would you please wait this letter to see with the postages?"
registered mail
By ordinary airmail please.
"No, I don't think so..."
A post order for four hundred dollars.
In that case, you 'd better have it registered.
"Yes, I will be informed that my friend gets the letter."
Yes, he 'll send the receipt which you send by mail. then you can be sure he's received.
"We'd better have a brief talk about the loading port."
"We are always willing to choose the big ports as the loading ports."
"What's your unloading port?"
She's pretty and meek.
No, I can't agree with you. She's one but not the other.
"I think it's a good idea..."
"What was that?"
"I said, " Is there anything I can do?" "
"If it's not too much trouble, I would like some help."
"Excuse me. "
"Yes, how can I help you?"
no
"Yes, I do. "
no
Yes, the limit is four per family.
" Okay, I 'll take four, please. You saved me a lot."

"Thanks. "

Steven: Hello, Steven. We're thinking of appointing an agent for our products. I want you to find one for us.
The agent is a sales agent.

"Yes, can we help you?"
"Yes, I can come and have a look. "
The narrator is having a problem with their relationship.
We have water coming through. It was raining yesterday and this morning we noticed a wet patch on our ceiling.

The narrator has found the blank ones.
"Yes, I have seen them. "
"Yes, well put your name on it after you have downloaded it off the company website. OK?"
Yes, I understand what to do.
The narrator has never used a 24 hour clock.
"What? Huh?"
"So after you noted the hours, starting at zero which is midnight, you just write down the minutes as a dot followed by minutes. Get it?"
Huh? What?
Just make sure you show your total, sign it, and turn it in.
" I thought you said this was easy. "
Watch your step. There's a hole in the sidewalk.
" Hello, how are you doing today? "
I've been having trouble breathing lately.
"Have you had any type of cold lately?"
No, I haven 't had a cold. I just have a heavy feeling in my chest when I try to breathe.
"No, I don't know of any allergies."
No, I don 't have any allergies that I know of.
Mostly when I am active.
"It happens a lot when I work out."
"I am going to send you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma."

Welcome to ABC electronics. First, let me go over what we do in the department during a typical workday.
" Ok. I understand that we basically work from 8: 30 to 5:30 with an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1, right?"
The lunch break is flexible, although we do expect you to do a little overtime if there's something important to do.
No, it's not allowed.
The main thing is that all our work must be completed on schedule. We even allow our employee to go home early if they finish their work early.
"How often do you have meetings?"
There are other meetings for people working together on certain projects.Department heads also attend an interdepartmental meeting each week.
" I've met some of my colleagues already. I'm sure we 'll get on well together."
" I haven't seen it yet. "
I was told to take a look at it this afternoon and take care of all the paperwork.
"Ok. This is your cubicle. At first, you 'll be responsible to me. Later, you 'll be working more independently."
I need to learn how you do things here first. Salaries are paid directly in to our bank account, aren 't they?
"What happened to my homework?"
The narrator's excuse is that he's not feeling well.
"Actually, I did it, but then it got lost."
"Yes, I could have gotten it done at another time."
Yes, I could.
I will be making this assignment up as soon as I can.
"I'll make it up early next week."
" That would work, but don't let it happen again. "
"I'll try. "
Sir, are you ready to order?
Yes, I'll have tomato soup and my friend will have mushroom soup.
No, I don't want anything to go with soup.
No, I feel worse.
My heart sank when Mary told me that she wanted to leave me.
" Don 't be sad. Everything will be fine. "
"How much altogether?"
"How much is 40 dollars?"

"We receive credit card as well."
Come in central, I think we've got ourselves a situation here.
Sir, have you been drinking tonight?
"I had one or two glasses of eggnog, but nothing else."
Sir, what do you have in the back?
"Just a few Christmas gifts, 'tis the season, after all!"
" Don't take that tone with me. Do you have an invoice for these items?"
"Umm... no... I make these in my workshop in the North Pole!"
You have the right to remain silent. You better not pout, you better not cry. Anything you say can and will be used against you. You have the right to an attorney. if you cannot afford one, the state will appoint one for you.
I don't have any more cash, and I have to get on another bus to get home.
None of the above choices.
"I wanted some chips at lunch today, so I spent it."
" That was a bright idea. "
"No, I don't have any money."
I don't have any change for you.
I need to get home.
"Why don't you just ask the bus driver for a transfer?"
I don't have money for a transfer.
Go ask for a transfer, they're free.
"Really? Oh! I'm glad you let me know. "
Yes, I would like to go to a party tonight.
" That sounds like a good idea. "
No, it would be too late.
No, I do not like chocolates.
"It depends. on what you want to do. "
No, I don't like coffee.
Um. It's delicious.
No, I don't like it.
"What can I do for you here?"
"I came here to ask for some information. "
"Ok. Please go ahead. "
I bought a pair of trousers last year, which I like the best, but this year they don 't fit me very well. They're tight in the waist, baggy at the knees. Can you make some alterations?
The shop has a history of more than 20 years.
"It seems I find the right place. "
Yes, absolutely! We have a very good reputation in the neighborhood.
"Yes, I can have them tomorrow if you bring it to me tomorrow."
"If you like you can wait here. They will be ready in one hour and a half."
"How may I help you?"
"I would like to return an item."
"What are you returning?"
"I want to return this cellphone. "
"Is there a problem?"
"It's broken. "
It's not working properly.
The phone turns off by itself.
"Yes, I have my receipt with me.
"Yes, here it is."
"I'll refund your money right now."

" George, how can we? Vacations cost money, and this month we don 't have much money left after paying the rent. "
Lili: We can visit different places in the state in our van. We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time. Trust me, it won 't cost much.
The dialogue responds to " Where will we sleep then?"
In the van.
"What about other expenses?"
We need to get out of the house once in a while, haven 't we?
"Maybe I'm right. When do you plan to go?"
"The sooner the better! I can 't wait!"
" Oh, I don 't know where we're going yet. "
As long as we're going, you can decide where to go, I trust your judgments. I know you miss Chinese food, so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time.
"Excuse me. Will you please keep an eye on my suitcase? I just want to make a phone call."
"Certainly, but will it take long?"
No, I'll be right back.
"This is Louise Walker calling from The Marketing Company. "
Ms Walker : Good morning. What can I do for you?
"Yes, I can come by and pick them up."
" Hey, look at the offer I got in my e-mail. It says that I can get rich quickly while working at home!"
No, I don't believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy.
"What do you mean?"
I mean that you're gullible. You shouldn't believe everything you read, especially on the Internet.
But it seems like a good idea. All I have to do is first send some money to the person who sent me the letter. After that he'll tell me how to earn much more money.
"Yes, I have heard of pyramid schemes before.
"Pyramid scheme? What is that?"
The person at the top asks the people below him for money, and then tells them to go and ask other people for money while sending some of it back to him.
"Sounds good to me. The guy at the top gets money and so do the people below him."
The scam keeps on going, with the people at the bottom paying more and more money until they reach the very bottom.
"What happens then?"
The people at the bottom give their money to the people above them and they get nothing.
"You should have been at home and enjoyed a big meal."
"Yes, I should have gone to buy the ticket in advance. But now..."
"But now you can stay with friends and enjoy a holiday too. "
The narrator is going to the beach this weekend.
"Nothing much. I'm going to the cinema on Friday night but that's all I have planned."
So you're free on Saturday night?
"That's right. "
"Yes, I would like to have dinner with you.
Shall we say seven o 'clock?
"No, I have never been to a hospital before."
"Yes, I worked as a doctor at Beijing People's Hospital."
The narrator has been there for a long time.
A little over 3 years.
In what section did you work in the hospital?
"Good morning. I've come here to inquire whether I can get a visa to your country?"
"What do you want to do in the US?"
"I have been invited to teach Chinese at the University of Hawaii for two years. "
"Yes, I'd like to have a look at your letter of acceptance."
"Of course. Here you are."
"We need to call an emergency meeting as soon as possible about this. "
The narrator will send a memo around.
Ken: I'm free this afternoon Ken: I'm free this afternoon Ken: I'm free this afternoon Ken: I'm free this afternoon
" I don 't think he's back today. "
"Oh, that's right. Go ahead anyways. I 'll fill him in. We can 't lose this order under any circumstances!"
I had an accident.
Sir, how can we help you today?
I need to find out some more information for L / C. I would like an outline of responsibilities, both ours, yours and the beneficiary, please.
"what are the shipping conditions?"
OK, got it. Is there anything else I need to know before we go ahead?
"What is a letter of credit?"
" Okay, so we're agreed on 900. "
"I'm happy with that price. "
"Let's shake on it."
"I'd like to start by talking about prices. "
"I'd be glad to answer any questions you may have. "
"Your products are very good, but the price you ask is much too high."
"If you consider our high research costs and excellent quality, the price we are asking is only reasonable."
I was wondering if you need any help on your new project.
The narrator is good at writing.
" I would like to help with the computer work. "
No, I am not comfortable working with others.
Yes, I like working like that.
"Yes, I will be available then."
Yes, I can be there.
Well, if you could send me your basic background information before next Monday, it would be useful.
OK, I will send the information to you.
Mike : Hi, Mike, what's up?
Hi, Bill, this is my new car.
" Hey, great set of wheels. "
" I like it, huh?"
"Who wouldn't? Wow, that's out of this world."
It is special, isn't it?
"Yeah, too cool. How much did they sold you for?"
"Lots. Looks like I'll have to moonlight for the next two years."
" I can imagine. "
"Hey, let's go for a spin. You can try it out."
"I'd love to..."
Tom: Can you give me a hand, Tom?
"Sure..."
The cork seems to be stuck.
"Then I must go-you have said it yourself. "
No, you must stay! I swear it, and the oath shall be kept.
"I told you I must go!"
The narrator is at home.
" I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere now. "
"I ask you to pass through life at my side-to be my second self and best earthly companion."
"Last weekend I didn't want to go out either, so I stayed at home and played video games by myself. It was really fun!"
" Oh yeah, that sounds pretty cool, I guess..."
"Yeah, I'm really into video games. In fact, all my friends are on the Internet. I've never met any of them in the real world."
"Yes, I'd like to invite you for dinner tonight. Do you think you'll have time?"
"Thank you for your invitation. I'm free tonight."
western food
I prefer seafood.
I will pick you up at your hotel at 5:30 p. m.
"That's fine. I'll be waiting for you."
The cafeteria around the corner is open today.
They were open this morning when I came to work.
" I thought that maybe we could go there for lunch today. That is, if you haven't promised to go with someone else. "
"That'd be wonderful, Peter. But I hope you're in a better mood than you were this morning."
"I'm sorry I was such a grouch. It must've been the weather. When it rains I get depressed."
The air conditioning is not working. We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here!
"Dan is on top of that. I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up."
"That would be convenient. They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring. The circuit breakers keep going out all the time. It ’s really annoying!"
Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that's why the parking lot was flooded.
My minibar is completely empty.
The minibar has been consumed.
"Everything's gone. "
"Yes, I'd like a cup of coffee. "
Jim Beam
" Okay, sir. Three of each. Would you like anything else?"
The fruit basket was great. I need a few more apples, please.
Perrier, Jim Beam, and apples. Is that it for now?
"Yes, one last thing"
" Yes, I think we could use one to decorate our room.
" I think we can have a try. "
"what is a tapestry?"
"Yes, it is a marvelous landscape in Guiling "
"I think it is. "
the linen one, the figured dacron or the brocade
"I'd like to pay my bill now. "
"Your name and room number, please?"
Tom Wilson: Room 306 Tom Wilson: Room 306 Tom Wilson: Room 306
No, I have not used any hotel services this morning.
No, I am not.
OK. You have stayed for four nights at 90 US dollars each, and here are the meals that you had at the hotel. That makes a total of 660 dollars.
no
"How do I order the office supplies that I need?"
Fill out this form with whatever you need.
I need many things.
" I can get a few of them right away, but might have to order some. "
"I can wait a few days for these items. "
"I don't know how much I have for office supplies."
" I don't think we have very much money for supplies, but we have a little. "
"Would you like them delivered to you or can you come get them here?"
I am not sure yet.
When you finish completing the request form, we will order and let you know when the supplies are here.
Ms. Monica : Good afternoon. I suppose you are Mr. Thomas, the general manager of ABC Company. Here is my business card.
"Thank you very much. "
I am very impressed by your resume. Therefore, I am very interested to know why you're willing to leave your current company.
I am looking for a more challenging position. I can 't grow anymore in my current job.
We have a lot of experience in this field.
I have studied carefully the information about your company on the internet and I have checked your company's homepage. I am impressed by the company and I like the products a lot. Since you're growing steadily, I would be very eager to help you to improve your accounting system.
How do you work with a team?
I work quite well with a team. I respect people, cooperate well with member's team, and I will do my best to help team members.
"What's your long term goal?"
David: Hello. Can I talk to you?
"Hello?"
"Yes, I do. "
I'm sorry, David is out of lunch right now.
I'm his wife. Could you tell him to call me back when he returns?
No, he doesn't.
"Oh, thanks. Please tell him to call my cell-phone number."
"Ok, I will. "
"Thank you very much. "
"Good morning. I 'd like to ask some questions about your insurance policies. "
"Of course. Please sit down. How can I help you?"
"I bought a house recently and would like to insure it and its content. "
I see. Here's a pamphlet about our home insurance policy. We've named our policy  umbrella ''. May I ask how much you paid for your home and where you live? These are the two main thing that decide how much your premiums are.
"I live in the Oakfield area and paid $ 100,000 for my home. "
Oakfield is a low risk area, so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month. The other thing to take into account is deductibles.
The minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000.
"It means that the first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you. The insurance policy covers any amount above that, up to the agreed limit."
None of the above choices.
"If you have higher deductibles, your premium are lower, because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less."
"I presume that the insurance period can be for as long as we agree."
"We initially sign one-year policies with our policyholders. These are renewable after the first year."
" I've heard that with some insurance companies, it can take months."
The man delivered a speech just now.
He's a liar.
"I was really glad to hear about your award. Congratulations!"
"Thanks, Denise. Actually, I was really surprised. I mean there were a lot of qualified people out there. "
"Sure. But the work you did was really exceptional! You definitely deserved it!"
" I can 't believe that Anthony is finally getting married!"
He's been living with his parents for 40 years!
" Don 't be mean. Look here come the bridesmaids! Their dresses look beautiful!"
The kids are walking down the aisle.
"That's the flower girl and the ring bearer. I'm pretty sure they're the groom's niece and nephew. Oh, they look so cute!"
" I just hope the priest makes it quick. I'm starving. I hope the food's good at the reception."
She's going to the wedding.
Sheila : What time should we meet tomorrow?
Half past two in the afternoon.
"What place is this?"
The usual place is in front of the treasure house.
And what should I wear?
"Your usual shirt and shoes."
The narrator is going to wear a dress.
Nothing unusual, I'm afraid.
Sheila, how about that fashionable blue dress?
" When I was at school, I was quite good at track and field events, I was on the school team for the long jump, 100 and 200 meter sprints and the javelin."
"I was quite good at the hurdles and the discus. "
I wish that I was good at the discus, but I could rarely throw it in the right direction!
"I thought you were good at the high jump!"
No, I was good at the long jump. I liked the sprints best.
No, I have never won any competitions.
" I usually did well in the dong jump competitions, but I couldn 't compete with kids from other schools in the javelin. How about you?"
No, I never took part in the national championship for the sprinting events.
Femi dumped me for that. I really loved her.
I'm so sorry, Taylor. Go talk to her. I'm sure she'd be happy to see you.
She probably wouldn't even recognize me.
"Yi-jun said Femi was talking about you. So get out there, Tiger!"
There is a chance.
" I love the peaceful life in Canada. "
"Yes, I want to live here "
"I'd like to, but I'm afraid I can't afford the life here."
Hi. I need to have my shoes repaired.
They are arguing with each other.
" Look at the heels. They are slanting. "
"Ah, I can do it perfectly."
"How much does it cost?"
6 yuan. And I can make them as new as before.
I think it's too expensive. I can just give you 4 yuan. Or I 'll go to another B.
All right, I 'll repair them for you.
"Yes, we can repair them while you wait."
Yes, they will be ready in a few minutes.
Come in, please.
"Good morning! I am Anna Lu. I've come for an interview which was arranged. "
Jack White, Personnel Manager.
Mr. White : Hi, Mr. White.
Miss Lu, have you got any experience in restaurant service?
Since I entered college, I have been working at a fast food restaurant as a part-time waitress.
"For how long?"
"how old are you?"
"Yes, we can serve them in English.
I am studying Hotel English in my college, and I am quite familiar with the western courtesy and restaurant etiquette. I am sure my public relation skills will leave a strong impression on your customers.
"You must know our working hours are very long and overtime work is frequent."
" I don't mind that. "
I think I will give you a 3 months'trial. The salary for this period is 800 yuan a month with no bonus. After that, if we both feel satisfied, a formal contract would be signed.
"When am I supposed to start working?"
Next Monday, bring your resume and diploma with you.
"Yes, I will. Goodbye!"
Ed: Hi Ed, what's up?
"Nothing..."
"Doesn't look like it to me."
"Just get out of my face!"
"Woo, easy. "
"Leave me alone!"
"What are you so ticked off about?"
"I don't want to talk about it. "
"Maybe I could help. "
" I blew the final exam. "
"You've got to be kidding..."
No, I'm not.
Order in the court!
"I would like to make my plea. "
"What is it?"
"I would like to plead not guilty."
"Yes, I do realize that all the evidence points to you. "
I know, but I did not do it.
The narrator is trying to figure out how to figure that out.
"I didn 't commit the crime. "
Do you know who did this?
"If I tell you who did, will you release me?"
" I'm sure we can work out some kind of deal. "
Sir, can I help you?
Yes, I'd like to withdraw some money.
"Fill in the slip, stating the exact amount you wish to withdraw, please."
No, it's not.
large notes
In 50 Yuan or 100 Yuan would be fine.
"Here's the cash for you. "
"Sorry, sir. I came late because I had to send for the doctor for my grandfather."
" I do sympathize with you, I assure you. "
" Thank you, sir. "
"I am a good computer user "
"My familiarity to computer is great and I use computer frequently in my daily life and work."
"What kind of software can you use skillfully?"
His father looks much younger in the picture.
He was 20 years old then.
He is a young man.
I think I have a good personality.
I'm quite active and energetic. I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like to leave things half-done.
introverted
"I'm quite outgoing i think. I enjoy mixing and doing things with others. "
"What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy?"
I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends. A friend in need is a friend in deed. The more really close friends I have, the better.
None of the above choices.
"What can I do for you?"
"Yes, what are your hours?"
"We open at lo."
Han Maimed : What's your plan for the weekend?
It's better to get to know it. What about you?
"I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays."
The dialogue response of " Oh, my God! John, I didn 't know you are religious. You just look like a scientific kook, like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory. "
Han Maimed: Come on, Han Maimed, don 't make a fuss. A lot of Americans, including many scientists, believe in religion.
I thought science and religion are not compatible, are they?
The United States is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world.
The narrator doesn 't understand how people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist.
It's a little complicated. You 'll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U. S. history later on. Religion was and is a part of American people's life. Guess what? Even Harvard University, which is a highly academic institution, is in a sense the product of religion.
"Yes, I am..."
"Absolutely! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England."
It was founded by the Puritans. Where were the atheistic educators?
Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans.
They were influenced by their parents.
" That's because in the 16th and 17th century, there was a series of religious reforms in England. Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries."
"No, they enjoyed religious freedom in England.
Puritans moved to the New World because they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans. Later on, it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College.
They wanted to help others.
"Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England. They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well."
" Oh, I see. "
Harvard was first named'New College ', without a formal name.
It began to be called Harvard University in 1836.
In 1639, it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard.
"It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion."
" Therefore, it's not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion, there would note Harvard."
" Wow, I didn 't know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history. "
"Religion has played an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U. S."
I finally begin to get to know Harvard. It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor. I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard.
Harvard is a part of the United States. So you have to know the U. S. history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard. The two are closely related.
" That's right, I have a lot to learn from you. "
"Excuse me, do you know where the visa office is?"
Yes, I do. I 'll walk you there.
"Thanks!"
no
I want to study abroad.
"What do you want to study?"
"I hope to study English literature. "
"Have you got your visa yet?"
No, I have an interview with the visa official today.
No, it is my first interview.
No, I've already been to here for three interviews.
"What happened?"
I was denied a visa.
The narrator is trying to figure out why he's not getting the results he wants.
Like most students, I want to work in America after graduation.
Sara: What are you doing over the weekend, Sara?
I'm planning to go balling tonight. Tomorrow I was hoping to see a movie.
I want to go camping, you know, just get a way for the weekend. I'm not sure I'll be able to, though.
None of the above choices.
Mary, I've some bad news for you.
I have already known that, right?
Yes, the board was favorably impressed with your application, but the competition was very fierce.
"Can you help me? You know I do need the scholarship. "
"I'm afraid I can't I advise you to try again next year."
It's a beautiful day here in New Zealand at the Men's Volleyball world championship. My name is Rick Fields and I'm joined by the man with the plan, Bob Copeland.
" Thank you, Rick. We've got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams, Brazil and China, face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round. Without a doubt, both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match."
The ref signals the start of the game and here we go. Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball. Chen bumps it to the setter and... a very nice set by Chen!
Xu spikes it! Wow, what a great hit! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in!
It's China's service now. What a superb jump serve by Li, oh, and we have a let serve.
Ma'am, can I help you?
"Yes. Could you tell me how to send money to someone with an account with a bank in Germany?"
By mail, telegraphic or SWIFT transfer. Or you can have a banker's draft and mail it yourself to the beneficiary.
The best way is to go by train.
A SWIFT transfer is the fastest method but a banker's draft is usually the cheapest.
$ 800.
None of the above choices.
"How long does it take to get here?"
About a week.
I don't know. Can I send it more quickly?
"Sure. You can have a telegraphic or a SWIFT transfer."
"And how long do those take?"
Both a Telegraphic Transfer and a SWIFT transfer will normally be credited to the payee's account within three or four working days, depending on whether the beneficiary's bank is among our correspondent banks or we have to route the transfer through a third bank.
I see. How can I pay by Telegraphic Transfer?
"What can I get you?"
Let me get a dozen croissants, four blueberry muffins and a loaf of sourdough bread.
"Sure. Would you like to have the loaf sliced?"
No, that's OK. Do you have any whole wheat bread?
"May I suggest some rye bread?"
No, I don't have any cakes.
"We have various birthday cakes and also ice cream cakes "
I'll just take a cheesecake.
"Yes, I do. "
Smith: I went to the University of California, Berkeley.
I went to Yale University.
No, I did not.
I have a B. A. in Economics.
"I'm a little older than you are..."
"I'm twenty-seven."
"I have had a lot of different jobs in my life..."
Yes, I have worked in a bank for the last five years.
"And what was your salary at the bank?"
It is nice and bright today, isn't it?
Yes, the autumn is marvelous here.
Tomorrow will be fine too, I think.
"Yes, there are some special requirements on the project. And shall we talk around it in details?"
Yes, there're some samples in our office and you can take some to study it. Besides, in recent years, we've visited a diversity of factory buildings all over the world and we hope that our building is the perfect match of advanced technology and attractiveness.
" That's a good idea. We can improve our technology to meet your special need. "
"And please let white color dominate."
"OK! I've noted it down. And any others?"
"Oh! I've almost forgotten the location was transferred to the A county in the east of the city."
"I'll tell them.
"Well, the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor."
"Please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise. And we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery."
" Thanks a lot. And I believe I'll have a good time working with you. "
"I think so. Bye!"
"I am here to help you..."
"I need to make some copies. "
The copier is right over there.
no
"We do charge to use the machine. "
"How much does it cost?"
"We charge ten cents a copy. "
"How many copies am I allowed to make?"
"There is no limit to how many copies you can make "
"Yes, I can show you how to use it "
"Please read the instructions on the copier. "
"Hello, Miss. Where is the button that controls my seat?"
"It's on the arm rest. "
No, I don 't think so.
Steve: Hi Steve. What do you think of the new supplier?
We haven't had any problems so far. They offer a 24-hour technical back-up service. We've called them in three times this month. They always arrive within a couple of hours.
"Yes, we have to pay extra for that.
No, I have never worked with a computer
Yes, I have been a data entry operator for three years.
"What kind of software can you use?"
I have working knowledge of Windows and Dos. Actually, I'm quite familiar with both Java and C + + Programming Languages.

He has been compared to Rimbaud, you know.
Sylvester Stallone
The narrator was last night at exactly nine twenty PM.
" Nine twenty pm, I couldn't say. I couldn't remember."
"No, I can't remember."
"I've absolutely certain..."
"Were you in or out?"
I'm not quite positive. I think I went out at about half pass nine.
No, I did not see anyone come into the block flats.
No, I didn't.
"Yes, I am.
Mr. Smith : Could you arrange an appointment with Mr. Smith?
"Sorry, Mr. Smith's agenda is full today. "
"Yes, I'm free tomorrow afternoon."
"I'm happy to see you again. "
"Me too. "
" We should do this more often. "
I am very interested in a new apartment near the Taxing Plaza, but the price is very high, I really can't afford it.
The dialogue response of "How much is it for each square meter?" is:.
It's 7500 yuan per square meter, and I really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room. Its total area is about 80 square meters.
" Yes, I will make a full payment.
I am thinking about buying the apartment by installments. The real estate agency says if I pay a 25% down payment, I can move in at once.
Mary: Hi, Bob, this is Mary.
Mary: Hello, Mary. Where do you work?
I work for an Internet company.
No, I am not going to vote.
No, I am not.
"Yes, and for the first time."
No, it is not.
I don 't know how to vote.
" Voting isn 't difficult. "
I'm not sure what laws are being voted on.
"They tell you everything on the ballot. "
They don't.
" You 'll be okay. "
"Thanks for telling me. "
"I am sorry to tell you that you failed in the job interview in our company. "
It is tough to accept it, I mean. But can you tell me why?
It is hard to tell. Maybe it is because you're not resourceful enough to be a manager.
" Look, here is a very special business card from an illustrator. Every time I go through my book of business cards, I will notice it. It is an eye-catching one."
"Wow, fantastic. I like the font and color for his name. It is creative yet personal."
It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people and other big private and public organizations.
Yes, she likes swimming.
She is good at backstroke and free style.
"Then you can help her with the breaststroke and sidestroke."
But she wants to learn the butterfly stroke
"Really? Then just ask her to follow me."
I heard you are now practicing underwater swimming, aren't you?
Yes, but I still have some difficulties in breathing.
Say, kid, keep on practicing, you're sure to be a first-class swimmer.
I have never thought of being a swimmer, I swim just for fun.

There is a Folk concert tomorrow evening.
I don't like Folk music very much.
"what kind of music do you like?"
No, I don't like classical music.
No, classical music sends me to sleep
I don't believe you.
It's true.
"You are funny!"
"Mom, Happy mother's day! Here's my card."
"What a surprise! Thanks. It's beautiful."

Mom, what can I do for you today?
Nothing, son. I'm already very happy.
"How about dinner tonight? My treat."
"Actually, I prefer we eat at home. We 'll have more time to catch up that way."
"I'm sorry I haven't dropped in that much these past few years. Business kept me too busy, I apologize."
" Oh, don't mention it. I'm proud of you!"
" I like it a lot.
I really doubt whether kung fu would be of any great help in real life.
Kung fu was originally intended for self-defense, but with time it became something more than defense skills. Now we are apt to treat it as an art.
The Chinese are really capable of doing things nicely. They even made fighting a great enjoyment, so marvelous and fascinating.
No, I don't know him.
"I know he is a martial arts fiction writer. But I've read none of his novels."
All of his works have been translated into English. I recommend you to read one or two works of his. You'll get a general glimpse into Chinese kung fu culture. When you go through the pages, you are likely to feel they are not about kung fu alone, but cover all walks of life.
I see. They must have incorporated a series of Chinese cultural elements.
"What makes a true, respectable da via, or a warrior hero? It's not enough only to be formidable. It also involves a man's character, sense of justice, and values of life."
"Yes, kung fu is also a means of self-cultivation. "
Julia: I think it's a good network.
The dialogue response of " Network is omnipresent nowadays. It's quite convenient for people. You see, we can download music and information from the Internet ; I can study from it, too. And the most of all, we can compose, send and receive e-mails. "
"Yeah, you are right. Internet makes our lives easier, but it's a two-blade sword."
"What do you mean?"
Internet brings benefit a lot, but also some disadvantages, for example, many youngsters are addicted to the games and they neglect their study ; or some bad guys steal people's money online, etc.
" I agree, but I think although it has some negative effects, on the whole the Internet does more good to us than harm."
I really want to switch things up.
"What were you thinking?"
I think I want to try a new style.
"What would you like me to do?"
"I want you to cut my hair shorter. "
"How long?"
" I want my hair to be only a few inches long. "
"Yes, I really want it that short."
"Yes, I've been wanting it short for a while now. "
"If you really want me to, then I'll do it."
"I'm absolutely sure that this is what I want."
"What is the proper way to sit at a dinner table?"

None of the above choices.
I'm a newspaper columnist. I write comments for a living. I enjoy working in a coffeehouse.
" I see. But isn't it a bit too noisy?"
I don't mind. By contrast, I quite like the circumstances, as I see a variety of people here, who can always give me tremendous inspiration. And the most important thing is coffee as it is my life.
I can see that, then what is your favorite coffee?
Irish coffee is my favorite. But I can drink any other. I'm not particular on it.
"Yes, I do, when I am at home.
No, I just buy takeout at Starbucks.
I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular. Though its taste is not perfect, it's really cheap and convenient.
Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee. People love it all over the world?
The country makes the best coffee in the world.
Many people think Brazil makes the best coffee. Brazil exports a lot of coffee. But I love Irish coffee. So it's hard to say. Just depends on your taste.
" I agree. I heard in the western countries, almost everyone likes coffee, is that true?"
No doubt about that, coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink. I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee.
No, we don't, especially the old people. But more and more young people fall for coffee.
My mom is 5 footsweet and very nice, and very caring, and very cute, everybody tells her how young she looks, and how she resembles my sister, perhaps. My father is very much completely opposite that.
The last time I talked to my parents was when I was a child.
" I talked to them probably about two weeks ago. Yeah, everything is going well."
" Yes, I am going to see them soon.
I am going to go home after the holidays and we're going to have a Christmas kind of in January or February, depending on when my brother can come in.

"Our new production control program's going live on Monday. The old and the new programs will operate in tandem for four to six weeks. That should give us time to iron out any little problems."

Many people in the North are fond of liquors, I think it has something to do with the climate.
No, I have never heard of it.
Yes, it's a very well-known kind of spirits in Mexico. People drink it with salt and lemon.
"Right. It's very strong, just like alcohol. ( Frank sips Mao Tai.
" Besides Mao Tai, we have Wu Liang Ye, Fen Jim and so on."
The wine tastes quite good.
It's a kind of still wine, somewhat like Japanese Sake. Showing is a city in China.
"I see. "
" By the way, we also have some good red wine and white wine, such as Great Wall White Wine."
"Thank you for telling me so much, I'll try them next time."
The golden watch is lost.
"Yeah. I just can't find it anywhere."
"It's an open book that it was stolen by the man in black."
Watch out! It's dark over there.
"That's all right. I can manage."
"Be careful! The road is muddy. You might slip."
The dialogue response of "Hello, Miss. I want to listen to the music. Could you tell me how to adjust it?" is :
There are several kinds of music. What do you like to listen to?
" I like listening to the classical music. "
" OK, here it is. Can you hear it?"
"Channel 2"
The last one clockwise.
"What can I do for you, sir?"
"We'd like to order breakfast for tomorrow morning. "
"Yes, sir. What would you like?"
"What would you like for breakfast?"

About seven thirty. By the way, could you also bring me tomorrow's papers?
"I have a lot of experience in this field.

"What's your technical post title now?"
"what is your profession?"
no
"Yes, here it is."
"Can you briefly tell me about one of your designs?"
I think it's time for some plastic surgeries. I'm tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin.
"I don't see any wrinkles or sagging skin! You'd better stop being so ridiculous."
"Anyway I think I need a nose job and some breast implants as well."
I think you need to get a brain surgery. Honestly speaking, you look charming.
I know what you mean. I just want to make myself more attractive.
" Besides, plastic surgery hurts. "
"Yes, I am..."
"The order is so urgently required that we have to ask you to speed up shipment. If shipment is too late, we'll have to turn to other suppliers."
"I am sorry, but we can't advance shipment. The manufacturers are fully committed. They have no stock on hand."
"Yes, of course, we can do that.
We can ship whatever is ready to meet your urgent need instead of waiting for the whole lot to get ready.
"Sounds like a good idea."
"We propose to deliver 50 % in June and the balance in August."
No, it is not.
"I'm afraid it gains a little. "
By how many minutes?
Miss, can I help you?
No, I don't have anything which can prevent wrinkles and freckles
"What is your skin type?"
My skin is kind of oily.

The price is reasonable for its large quantity. What's more, there are some gifts attaching for you.
The narrator is excited about the gifts.
"You can take one tonic or hand cream."
I will choose the tonic.
No problem. You can try this kind of gel which can prevent freckle, the effect will be better if you use this powder foundation applied with it.

Good luck to you!

No, I am not going to take his advice.
Yes, I am looking for a position as a chef.
"I might be able to help..."
"I'm sure you have great connections. "
"We'd like to open another restaurant... with you as the head chef and manager..."
"Yes, he knows who I am."
He's just worried that you're not Italian.
He is prejudiced, isn't he?
No, he's afraid that no one will cook as good as his mother did.
"I know a way to convince him that Americans can make good Italian food!"
The narrator is describing how they are feeling.
I need to see if I qualify for a home loan.

" How much does a six day tour by train cost?"

"I like them a lot.
" To tell the truth, I don't think much of them."
"You're becoming a real television watcher. "

Mr. Bush, this is your bill, please sign your name here.
I think something must be wrong with my bill. I didn't have any laundry.
"Have a nice weekend. "
no
"Yes, I do. "
I feel it's a good idea.
"What qualifications should a reporter have?"
As a reporter, he must have acute insight and language skills, at the same time, he must have good judgment, the respect for his job and tactical cooperation with others.
"Yes, I can work under pressure. "
"We'd better leave now. "
"Good evening, may I help you?"
"I would like to book a table for six tonight. "
"Sorry, sir. We have only double tables left."
"What a pity. Can you recommend a nice restaurant near here?"
This computer isn't working properly.
I told you so. I kept having problems with it yesterday. I don't know what's wrong.
Ms Harrow: Hello. It's good to see you again, Ms Harrow, sending more money to your grandson today?
"Yes, we do.
"What would you like to know about me?"
"What is a timing deposit?"
"what is a time deposit?"
The laundryman is here to collect it.
Yes, I have. Here are my blouse, coats and stockings.
"Anything else?"
"Oh, yes. My husband also has some laundry. This is his suit and here is his pajamas."
No, they are to be washed.
No, only the suit and coat are to be dry-cleaned. I want to have my blouse tomorrow evening. And I'd like the collar and cuffs starched.
" Yes, but not too stiff, right?"
"Yes, it is possible to have my overcoat dry cleaned, too."
"There are a few spots on it. I am afraid you will not have it tomorrow. Dry-cleaning usually takes three days."
No, I also need this tomorrow evening.
I suppose I could ask the dry-cleaner to clean up the spots for the moment, and have it well pressed. You might get it back on time then.
" That's a good idea. "
" By the way, a cotton came off your shirt you gave me the day before yesterday. "
Yes, I noticed it yet.
The laundry has sewed on a new button for you.
" Oh, thanks a lot. "
"I am afraid the new one is not exactly the same as the others. "
"Never mind, it doesn't matter."
"What kind of job are you interested in?"
" I want a job in which I can use English, I would also like to have some responsibility in my work."
" I really appreciate that I would expect my secretary to be able to work independently and take over some of my ordinary responsibilities, such as answering routine correspondence, taking phone calls for me and sometimes assisting me with personal affairs."
"Yes, I see. In my previous job, I did typing and filing everyday. "
"Yes, I am a tour guide. "
"I have shown some of my foreign friends around Beijing. "
"Once in a while we have visitors from abroad and I would like to ask my secretary to take them shopping and sightseeing."
"Have you heard what happened?"
Heard what?
Deborah already had her baby.
"I didn't know that. "
" I thought you knew. "
" I honestly didn't know. "
The baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces.
" That's good to hear. "
"Yes, I will go and visit them "
"Of course I will. "
"I just wanted to give you the good news. "
"Excuse me, what's the checking time for flight FA1187?"
No, I haven't paid the airport fee.
"Yes, and I have already gone through the safety inspection."

"Hey, look out!"
"What happened?"
"Oh, God, a paint was scratched off."
"Where is my car?"
No, mine!
" Thank goodness! "
"I've just had it repainted."
" That's terrible. "
" I am sorry to say this, sir, but you should've been more careful. "
"I apologize for that. But the space is too small."
"It's gonna cost me a lot of money.
"Can we solve this later? I am calling the insurance company."
"Mary, set your alarm clock for seven tomorrow morning."
The narrator is trying to figure out why he's not getting the results he wants.
"I'm going to take you to your school to register for classes."
"That's right. I haven't done that yet."
"You can choose classes at the school office."
"Yes, I am..."
"Well, there are core courses and electives."
"What do they mean?"
"Ahh chooo!"
No, I'm fine.
No, every spring time around April, I am stricken with allergies.
"I never have seasonal allergies. "
" Consider yourself lucky. "
"What are all the symptoms?"
As you just saw, I sneeze a lot. Also, my nose becomes very runny, my throat sometimes itches, and my eyes start to water.
"That doesn't sound good..."
No, it's not. So you don't have any type of allergies?
"Well, I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol. It runs in the family."
Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol.
My whole face turns red, including my ears. My eyes become bloodshot, and I start to itch all over my body.
" That's pretty bad. "
"I need to find a bus that'll take me to the Gold Line."
"Where do you live?"
"I live up in Altadena."
The 264 will take you there.
It goes all the way there.
"I know for a fact that it goes to the station. "
The street would be on the left.
"If you go to Altadena Drive, you can catch it there."
"I didn't know that bus went to the Gold Line station."
"Yup, it does."
"Well, thanks for letting me know. "
"I don't know what to do about the people who live above me!"
None of the above choices.
They're always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that I have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep!
"No, I haven't talked to them about it."
"I tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in, but they were so arrogant that I didin't want to ever talk to them again!"
"What did they say?"
" They both just talk about how great they are all the time. "
"They sounded like the neighbours from hell!"
" Besides being loud and arrogant, they're also terrible gossips. They're always talking about everybody else in the apartment. "
" I thought you didn't talk to them much. "
I don't, but they talk so loudly that I can hear what they're talking about from my bedroom - and it's not very nice.
The other people in your apartment think about them a lot.
"Most of my other neighbours are scared of them."
"Maybe you should think about moving. "
"I can't afford to move right now. "
"Well, perhaps you should have a party and try to get to know them better. Maybe once you know them, they'll turn out to be more sensitive."
I think you're being a bit optimistic. If you met them, you 'd understand.
"So, now I need your help again, if you don't mind. I'm taking a date to a restaurant."
I'd love to help you! What is your budget for the dinner?
She strikes me as being very sophisticated. Only the best will do for her.
It is very upscale, with a three-star rating.
I don't want to be cooped up in my own hotel tonight. How about another restaurant?
The Gramercy Tavern is highly rated, but it's not cheap.
Yes, that sounds like a winner. Would you please call them to reserve a table?
I think we need a lot of drinks.
The dialogue response of " Well, not everyone wants to drink beer. Make sure there are some soft drinks and juice. Nothing's as refreshing as iced drinks on a hot day. "
I don't think we need too much in the way of soft drinks, Two super bottles of Cola should cover everyone. What about wine?
No, I haven't.
No, once I fill the tub with beer, I'll get the ice. The cooler, the better.
I think a bottle of champagne would be a good idea. It's appetizing and tasty.
I would like to have a custom-made skirt.
May I take your size?
" OK. I want it a bit close around the waist. "
No problem.
"How long will it take?"
About a week.
"What's the charge for the tailoring?"
First, tell me about your education, please.
I graduated and got the degree of bachelor of economics from Nanjing University 4 years ago. My major is international trade.
"Can you name some terms of payment?"
Frank is getting married, do you believe this?
No, he is not.
Yes, he is. He loves the girl very much.
"Who is he marrying?"
A girl he met on holiday in Spain, I think.
No, they haven't set a date yet.
I want to have this photo enlarged.
"What size do you want it to be?"
"I want to have it the size of a page from an ordinary book."
None of the above choices.
One is OK. How much does it cost?
Eleven yuan.
"Here's twenty yuan. "
Lin Tao: Hello, this is Lin Tao. I am calling to inquire about my interview result last week.
" Hi, I am sorry to say that your experience doesn't fit the job at all."
"Sorry to hear that, but could you inform me why I failed?"
May I take your order?
"We'd like this course for two, please."
"I'm afraid this course is for four persons. "
"Well, can't you make it for two only?"
"I'm afraid not, sir. "
I recommend that you go to a doctor.
" I would recommend a soup with two or three small dishes. "
" Right, we'll have these three. "
No, I don't like rice.
No, thanks.
The narrator is going to a party.
I'm going to the hospital.
"What's the matter?"
Professor Wang was hurt in a traffic accident.
It's too bad. How are things now?
" Guess what? I've got great news!"
"What is it?"
"Well, I've been working at the Economist as a proof-reader, right?"
"Yes, I do. "
"Well, the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him."
The narrator will get a chance to write.
She said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back.
The magazine comes out once a month.
"It's a monthly magazine, but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly."
No, I am not looking forward to it.
"Yes, but I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again!"
No, there are no order forms here.
I don't have any with me, but I think I could manage to bring a free copy home for you.
"I'm really looking forward to reading your column. "
The narrator wants to go out to celebrate his good news.
"where would you like to go?"
The narrator is working on a project.
" I'm figuring out my budget. "
"What is your budget?"
"I'm making a shopping budget, so that I don't spend too much money."

"I can only spend $ 300 a month. "
None of the above choices.
"I need to save the rest."
The narrator is looking for a job.
"I need to pay my bills. "
"Your budget is a good idea. "
"Excuse me, where is the Beijing railway station?"
"You can take the subway to get there."

"Excuse me. Sir. Where is the No 1 bus stop?"
"Pleas turn right at the traffic lights."

Yes, you have to pay in cash.
No, we have an easy-payment plan. One-third down, and the balance in six months.
The narrator will work out the details, please.
Certainly. Would you sit here please? I'll call our credit manager.
"Thank you. "
"It's just a formality but for hire purchase we usually require references."
"What kind of references do you need?"
"Perhaps your employer could supply us with one."
"I'm sure he could, but I prefer not to bother him. Would my bank do?"
May: file_photo> May: file_photo> May: file_photo> May: file_photo>
"Yes, that's right, that's the poster of the Witch."
May : I really regret watching it with you last night.
"Yes, it scared me "
"Of course not. I just thought the movie was... boring."
Come on, you clutched to my arm all the time.
"Well, I admit, the ghosts were scary. "
" I like scary movies "
The dialogue response of " That's Gucci's influence. I love science fiction movies!" is:
No, they are silly stories.
"Don't call me kid. I am a grownup."
No, I don't like scary movies.
"Of course! I can watch them without you!"
"I got it on the internet "
"I found it at a garage sale once. "
Mom, will you have time to help me with my homework today?
Some people are easily flimflammed.
"Maybe they are still wet behind ears."
" Blind people are more easily conned, of course."
Mr. Johnson, there's something I'd like to talk over with you. Would sometime this week be convenient for you?
Let me see. Would it be okay on Wednesday morning?
"That'll be fine. "
Happy New Year, Bill.
Happy New Year, Steven.
"I have no plans for the New Year holiday."
My whole family is going to Hainan for visiting.
What's up? You look so blue.
"Yes, they can go and root for their old school team. "
"Yep. And relive those good old high school days."
" You don't sound too excited about going to your reunion. "
I'm not. I get a stomachache just thinking about it.
no
"I went to the doctor yesterday. "
"I beg your pardon?"
"I said I had been to the doctor the day before. "
"What did he say?"
He said I 'd got the flu.
"What did he tell you to do?"
He told me to stay in bed for ten days.
"Ten days? Would you please repeat it again?"
The robbery happened.
No, I saw it happen.
"Yes, I am..."
"I was there. "
"What happened?"
A man came into the bank with a gun.
" That's insane. "
" I was so scared when I saw the gun. "
Then what happened?
He took the money and tried to get away.
No, the police did not show up in time.
"What a beautiful watch. It goes very well with your ring."
"Thank you. "
No, it is my engagement ring.
"I'm not married yet. It's my engagement ring."
Well, congratulations. When is the big date?
" In June..."
Yes, I had the watch before getting the ring.
"Actually we bought the ring together after I got the watch."
"You did a fabulous job with the selection. It's gorgeous."
"Thank you so much. "
It is a watch.
"It's a Tag Heer."
"They cost a lot of money..."
This one is $ 1500. But they range from $ 600 to $ 3000.
"That's why it looks so nice. I should have figured. You always get what you pay for."
Jason : Good morning. How did you sleep?
" How are you doing? "
"Yes, I am ready for a full day of shopping."
"Yep. Let's do it. I'm pretty excited!"
I know a place that should be perfect. It's called the China Friendship Shopping Center and it's pretty much like an American mall - except with more variety. You can even buy a live chicken there if you want.
The narrator is not interested in buying live chicken.
You'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person. You're a foreigner and the sellers can see that. But... if you're smart, you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price.
"Cool! Teach me!"
For starters, you want to do a lot of scouting first, you've got to know what things cost.
"Someone told me to go to a convenience store and see how much a soft drink or a tube of toothpaste costs. The idea is that by comparing the prices of those items, you can figure out the relative prices of everything else."
"So, where can I start my work?"
"what is an accountants job role?"
I represent a company.
"Our company just concluded a business transaction. You can help with documenting varies financial sheets involved in this transaction."
" Ok, thank you. "

"Dad and mom?"
"Yeah, they said they're reviving the old tradition."
"Yes, it will be a regular thing."
"Let's have lunch together today."
It's a good idea.
I want a hamburger and ice cream. What about you?
I don't like hamburgers. They have no taste.
cheese cake
The narrator is depressed.
"I went bankrupt and I'm flat broke now. "
" If I can do anything for you, don't hesitate to let me know. "
"Come on, you are left behind!"
"Wow, I can't catch my breath, honey.
"You just need more exercise. "
This is jogging, not racing!
I don't care. I want to burn up my fat.
"But running so fast is not good for people over forties."
The narrator is trying to figure out why he's not getting the results he wants.
Mild exercise is more suitable for us.
"But I want to lose weight!"
In fact, in order to burn up your fat, you must take it slowly for a longer time.
"Sorry. I didn't mean to be late. Can I come in?"
The narrator's excuse this time is that he's not feeling well.
No, I haven't used it yet.
"Yes, twice last week."
"I thought I said it was my mother. "
"I don't think so. But it could've been."
My sister is definitely sick. I'm just coming from the hospital. They say she might even die.
" I don't buy your story. Try not to have any more sick relatives this week, all right?"
"I'll do my best. "
"Just try to be a little more punctual in the future."
"Can you help me please?"
Certainly sir.
There is a Japanese restaurant near the hotel.
"Actually there's one on the same street as this hotel."
"Is it far?"
Congratulations! You've just won a car!
I just got a letter from an old high school buddy.
"Really? That's nice. "
He usually keeps me posted.
"I've been completely out of touch with my old friends. "
"It's hard to keep up contact when people move around so much. "

"Are you kidding me?"
I had no plans, so I made plans with Mark.
"We have been together for a year and usually, people who've been together a year, take their vacation together."
"I don't think that I ever heard of that rule before. Any more rules that you would like to tell me about?"

"I need to improve my English. "

"I think a one-to-one course will be too expensive for me, so a group class would be fine."
"Yes, I have, but I haven't taken one yet.
I think I prefer face-to-face instruction better.
"That's fine. If you want, you can sign up for a pre-sessional interview."
"What's that for?"
"one of our qualified teachers will interview you so that they can find a class that suits you best."
"Yes, we have a brochure about the course that you can take home to read. "

"I like the black one. May I try it on?"
"Of course. It fits you perfectly."
" How much is it?"
"It's forty-five yuan."
"Yes, we can make it much cheaper."
" It seems to be clearing up. "
" It's such a nice change. "
" I really don't think this weather will last. "
"Hello, Fairbrook Consulting, how may I help you?"
"Yes, this is Julianne Horton, and I'm calling to arrange an appointment with Ms. McNeal."
"Certainly, what day were you thinking of?"
She has no time available on Thursday.
She's booked solid on Thursday, how does next Monday work for you?
"I've got something scheduled on Monday. Can she do Tuesday?"

No, I have never had a foreign instructor in English composition.
"Yes, my college teacher was an Australian. She was also our adviser on our English language newspaper. I was the editor for two years."
"That's very interesting. Tell me what you did exactly. "
"Well, I planned the layout of the newspaper and then I assigned various articles and columns to other students to write. I wrote the editorial each time."
I want to be a journalist.
" To be frank with you, I would like nothing better than to be an overseas reporter some day. "
" That can be a rough job, you know."
I like adventure and excitement in my writing.
"Well, working in an editorial office may not be exciting enough for you. What do you think?"
" I would be glad to do routine work sometimes, if I could be assured of making advancements in the future."
I think this type of position would be a very good start for you, but I cannot give you a definite answer today. We will let you know within just a few days.

I play tennis there every week. Shall we have a game one day?
"Sir, may I please see your license and registration?"
No, I ’ m not sure. I think about 65 mph, right?
The narrator was speeding at 90 miles per hour.
No, Officer, not at all.
The narrator can not explain their behavior.

Yes, I was using a cell phone.

I'll give you a blood test. Would you roll up your sleeve?
"How smart of you to book the tickets before hand!"
No, I don 't think so.
"Of course, otherwise you 'll just have to wait for hours."
The website is very effective at marketing.
"We've been able to survey and track some of the information of our website users through some cookie technology, and it's surprising to see the results."
"What kind of hits are we getting on our company's website?"
The narrator is convinced that the internet is the marketing power of the future.
"I really think that many people turn to the internet to find product information. What about the old standbys of word mouth and print media?"
"Have you decided what you are going to take next semester?"
"Well, I'm an English major, you know. So I came here to make sure I'm taking the right things."
Good, I think it's a good idea. Our department should require meetings like this.
I want to finish my degree in four years.So I don't want to forget to take classes I need. I have a friend who has to stay in college another year. She didn't know until recently. There were some classes she needed to take to graduate.She didn't know about them.
"Yes, that happens."
"I brought my transcript from my first year. Here. And here is the list of courses I plan to take in the fall."
No, I took English Composition 201.
No, I don't need to. I took Advanced Placement English in high school. So I'm not required to take composition.
"Excellent. I see you have the 18th century poetry class for next semester. And the modern novel class. You haven't taken a Shakespeare class yet."
No, I thought I would take it later.
"Actually, I recommend you take Shakespeare sooner rather than later."
Well, I suppose I could cross out the 18th century poetry class. I have to see when the Shakespeare class meets.
"Shakespeare meets Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 11"
"I can take it then. I have that time slot free."
Good, I recommend it. Shakespeare is of course enormously important.We want our students to take the class as soon as they can.And Professor Friedman is an excellent teacher.
"I'll take it then. "
Lisa: I wanted to be an English major.
I want to be an English professor in the future. I love studying literature and I want to teach it.
"Really? That's great to know."
Dr. Miller would like to talk to me about taking one of his classes.
No, I have never been in one of his classes.
"I'm thinking about taking his class next semester. "
He was a very easy teacher. Are you thinking of taking a class with him?
I'm not sure because I really need to learn something, but I also worry about grades.
"Yes, I think it is important, too.
" I really need to learn this stuff. "
" He made everything so interesting that the time just flew by. Do you know what I mean?"
Yes, that sounds right for me.
He came here last year after 10 years in the military.
"Yeah, I already knew that "
"What can I do for you?"
"I would like to open another account. "
"I want to open a restaurant.
"I want to open a savings account. "
no
"Yes, I do. "

"I want to transfer $ 100. "
" I 'll do that right now. "
The narrator has a problem.
I don't feel like eating. And I cannot sleep well.

"That's right.
Well, you have fun.
The screen near the steering wheel is for navigation.
It's a portable TV. It's a popular thing now.
"Oh, that's new to me. So what's on everyday?"
"what is tv news about?"
"Is there anything interesting?"
" Yes, there are something good and informative. I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education. "
No, there are no commercials on the TV.
Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs.
The TV works well.
Not always. It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals.
No, I pay for the programs.

No, I really don 't know anyone.
No, I just arrived in this country.
No, I was here last semester, but I didn 't find out about this class in time. So I'm taking it this semester.
"I took this course last semester too. Now I am taking it again!"
It was a good course.
I learned a lot. In fact, that's why I am taking it again. I get lots of practice in speaking, and also in writing. I'm sure you 'll be glad you took this course. I 'll even help you study if you 'd like.
"I would like to exchange Chinese money into German currency please."
Certainly. How much will you be exchanging today?
50,000 RIB would be a problem.
" That's a hefty amount, but that should have no problem at all. You should be aware that there is a ten-percent service charge, though."
"Ten percent! Now that's hefty!"
"No, I don't have an account with them."
"Yes, I do. Here is my account number."
5 dollars
"3,000 marks in hundreds and the rest in tens and twenty's, please."
"Can you change American dollars into French francs?"
"How much do you want?"
"What is the exchange rate for fifty dollars today?"
" One dollar to five franc. Is that alright?"
"Yes, please. and you can cash my travelers check, can 't you?"
"Of course we can. "
I won 't be here tomorrow. What are your business hours?

The narrator is going to a party.
I'm going to buy a CD.
Listening to music online is a great way to save money.
"Yes, I will have to pay quite a lot to listen to music online, isn't it?"
"You can audition music on line, and you can audition it off line after downloading it, so you needn't pay for it."
"I have downloaded one, but it still can't be listened."
In order to listen to music, you must have the necessary software.
"Yes, I can recommend some to you.
Certainly. Realplayer is a good.
no
Yes, but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it.
The dormitory is good.

The weather is really miserable. It has been raining hard all day long.
"Yes, it's so cold. "
The rain is going to let up soon.
Yes, I think so. The rainy season will be over soon.
The rainy season lasts from May to October.
About two months.
I can hardly stand these wet and cold days. It seems that it doesn't bother you very much.
"I'm used to this kind of days. "
"But I prefer warm weather. "
Spring will come soon. And we will have some pleasant weather then.
I 'd like to withdraw some money from my account.
"Yes, I'd like to see your passbook and with your draft please."
"Yes, I am.
Let me just make sure. You want to withdraw one thousand dollars.
No, I do not believe in palmistry.
"What is palmistry?"
"What is palm reading?"
"Oh, you mean palm reading 5. I've seen that before, but I don't believe in it."
I have read a lot about palmistry and I've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm. Do you want me to take a look at your hand?
"Really? You've read books about it? Ok, then. But only if you want to."
" Ok, well, you've got a long life line, which is good, and the love line is strong..."
I will make a lot of money.
"Hmm, hard to say, wait, yes, it looks like you will do well in business, and your ambition will help you a lot, but..."
"What's the matter?"
"You seem to have a large gullibility line. You believe everything that you're told. "
"Yikes! What was that noise?"
"I had to blow my nose."
No, I had to blow right next to the phone.
"Yes, I did.
"Of course I heard that. I thought a plane had crashed into your house."
"It wasn't that loud. "
I will blow my nose sometime for you, and you 'll see.
" Okay. I'll take your word for it. "
" I thought you had an elephant in your house. "
"You're funny..."
"What did you say? I think I've gone deaf."
Francis: Hi Francis, how was your business trip?

"It's still a nightmare..."
The air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge. I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam. When I finally got home, I was totally exhausted. But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout.
No, they did not trace it back.
" I am still waiting for their call. "
Yes, I am in favor of it.
The narrator is planning to go somewhere.

It was really busy. I had to work straight through my lunch break.
"Yes, I got to leave early.
"my boss told me that I could either go home early or take a long lunch break another day, so I decided to wait and take a long lunch break another time."
It was nice of your boss to give you an option. My boss would never do that.
It was a good day.
It was horrible! It was just one thing after another.
The narrator looks pretty upset.
I'm fine, but I have bad news.
"What's that?"
I got sacked today.
"You're kidding! How did that happen?"
It was the third time I was late this week.
The narrator was late.
Only about 5 minutes.
The narrator got fired for being a few minutes late.
He never arrives late, usually works over-time, and always gets his work done on time.

The city square, please.
"Yes, I am in a hurry "
"Yes, I have to be there to meet a friend at 5 thirty pm. So we're sure we can get there on time?"
I'm afraid not, sir. Generally we can, but you know how it is in the rush hour now.
I see. Here's the extra 5 $ for you if you can get me there on time.
" All right. I'll do my best. "
"We made it. Thank you. How much do I own you?"

And we're going to have summer vacation.

"Excuse me, could you tell me how to get to the Cross Bakery building?"
The Cross Bakery building? Oh sure. You're actually walking in the opposite direction.
"Oh, you're kidding! I thought I was heading east."
No, east is the other direction. To get to the Bakery, you need to turn around and go three blocks to Broadway. When you get to the intersection of Broadway and Elm, you hang a left. Go straight down that street for half a block and then you'll see the building on your left.
" Okay, let me see if I've got that. I need to go down Elm until I hit Broadway, then I make a left and the building is on my left hand side. Is that right?"
"Yeah, you've got it. Do you want me to show you the way?"
" Honestly speaking, you are very suitable for this job "
Thank you very much for your evaluation. I also like this job very much.
"I want to know your earliest available entry time. "

The bus is going to go to the next place.

The London Eye is just round the corner.

No, you can send it by registered mail.
Certainly.
"How much will I have to pay?"
Two yuan, please.
"Here are the letter and the money. "
It seems that your letter is overweight. Let me weight it.
No, it is not overweight.
"I'm afraid it is. So you will have to pay two yuan extra. The total charge is four yuan."
"All right. Here is the money."
"Here are the stamps and your receipt. "
None of the above choices.
"You can keep it until the addressee tells you that the letter has been delivered. It is the proof that you sent the letter if it fails to arrive."
"That's $ 60 in all."
"Yes, I can have them delivered to this address "
"Sure. You can go to the front desk to ask for more help."
" Oh, no! "
"How dreadful!"
"Look at the view from the window."
" Oh, dear. That's terrible. Not at all what I expected. "
It's awful, isn 't it?
" I can 't bear to look at it. I'm rather disappointed."
No, I don't feel like it.
"I'd like that very much. "
7:30 is a good time for a meal.

200 rolls of each.
3 rolls altogether
"That makes 5,000 rolls in all."
" Six weeks, did you say?"
Yes, five to six weeks.
"We could manage the plain rolls in six weeks. The prints might be put off to eight weeks."
"Eight weeks? We can wait that long. "
" That's the best we can do just now, I'm afraid."
"Can't you make it seven weeks for the prints?"
"What about taking the prints in two shipments? Two thousand rolls in seven weeks, and the remained a week later?"
I shall have to cable our Beijing office to get their approval. You can definitely supply in the time you've given me, I suppose.

When can we expect your confirmation of the order?
"As soon as I hear from Beijing, that will be either Friday or Saturday."
The weekend is finally here!
"And it's a long one. I have Monday off. It's Memorial Day or something like that."
"Yep. It's the kickoff of the barbecue season. We're invited to a grill party in the park tomorrow."
"What do we need to bring?"
"We need to buy some buns for the hot dogs and hamburgers, and I'm making potato salad."
" I can 't wait to retire. "
"And then what?"
"And then I'm moving to Florida where I can play golf all day, every day!"
" That sounds boring to me. "
I plan on doing nothing after I retire.
Yes, I think I will do something new. I've always wanted to be a teacher. I'm willing to begin studying to teach.
I would like to be a doctor.
As I have some administrative experience from my last job, I may use my organizational and planning skills in the future.

" I think it will be a good industry.
"It was built in the 1860s. "
"I'm not sure when it started, but I know it's older than me. As a young boy, I used to eat here a lot."
Dad told me you brought him here when he was young, too. Now, it's my turn.
"What do you want to eat today?"
I'd like to eat a hamburger and a bottle of coca-cola.

Then there is nothing particular I'd like to eat. Grandpa, what's your favorite here?
The Chinese rice pudding. Your father loves it, too.
No, it is not sweet.
No, of course. But I think they can make you a salty one, too.
" Great, I want it spicy. "
Come on. Don't go too far.
I want it to be special. And you know that I always like hot food.
Sir, can I help you?
"What time is check in?"
The dialogue response of " 12:00. You have to wait for a while." is:
" OK. "
I will show you the waiting room. You must be tired. Have a short rest there. We will call you later.
"Well, my particular interest is collecting stamps, especially the rare ones. What about you?"
I'm afraid that's not my cup of tea. I just find skin-diving attracting.
Dr.Black will be able to see me at 9:00 a. m. tomorrow.
She won't have any openings until 11:00, unless there's a cancellation.

"Great. I'll see you on Saturday."
"I have never done this before and don 't know where to begin as far as making an offer on this house. "
"Leave the details of making the offer up to me. What were you thinking you should offer?"
"I absolutely must have this house and will pay three hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more."
It is best to start a little low on the first bid to allow for a counter-offer. How about offering three hundred and twenty thousand dollars?
" I hope that the owners aren 't insulted by that offer. "
"Your offering price is not out-of-line. The owners will either take it or make a counter-offer."
No, it usually takes a few days.
It usually doesn 't take very long for owners to respond to an offer.

Yes, it was love at first sight.
I wasn 't looking for a holiday romance, but my sister told me that she had promised him that she 'd set him up on blind date with me. I didn 't think I 'd have anything to lose, so I went.
"And?" is the dialogue response of "And?"
"Let's just say that by the third date, we both realized that we had fallen in love."

No, I am not ready for a serious relationship.

I wish I could play a musical instrument. I love music.

Firstly, we can provide our meeting agenda before he comes. And then on the day when he is coming, we wait for him at the gate of our company's gate.
I should say thank you.
"It's an honor and a privilege to receive a visit from such a distinguished group. "
We should introduce them to each other.
"Maybe we should send them to the reserved hotel for a short break, while we can also raise a question on what they want to have and know."

" That's my problem, I don 't have a lot of options. "
"I usually go to a shoe store to buy shoes.

I need 1,000 RIB for my expenses, you see.

"You do need to take some medicines with you. Just in case. "
"What is your understanding of a job?"
" Besides, it simulates you to purse noble dreams."

"That's true dedication. I'm impressed. When is it due?"
"We agreed that the deadline was next Friday. "
" Well, given that your colleagues are working so hard on this project, I suppose we could change that deadline to Monday morning, I won't have time to look over it on the weekend anyway."
" That 'd be very helpful. An extra weekend is all they really need. Thanks."

I am sure that I can get there in time

So how do you survive from pay day to pay day?
I know when I get paid where most of the cash will go, and I stick to my plan. If I follow a budget I don't have any nasty surprises.
I'm not disciplined enough I guess.
All I do all day is work and watch TV. I really should start thinking about my health.
I think we should do something about it.
" For starters, we should start doing more outdoor activities. That way we 'll get some exercise. "
I think it's a good idea.
It is not a bad idea. How much is it?

"The customer got back to us this morning and they have agreed to pay a Discrepancy Fee of 100 US dollars."
No, we do not have any tables.
Yes, we have plenty of tables in stock. Will you have a look at this one?
It's a nice color, and the style is not bad, but a bit too small. I 'd like to get a slightly larger one.
"How about this one?"
Mmm, how much is it?
"Seventy US dollars.?"
"Yes, I'd like you to deliver this to my house."
"Of course. We are always at your service."
"Here is my name card. Thanks."
May I help you?

He's eating me out of house and home. I've tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out of the other. He makes himself at home, which is fine. But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over!
I really think you're beating around the bush with this guy. I know he used to be your best friend in college, but I really think it's time to lay down the law.
"Excuse me, I'm looking for the album Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie. "
The dialogue response of "Let's see. If we have it, it should be over there under M. Hmm, it looks like we've sold out of that one, but we should be getting some more copies in soon. If you want, we can order it for you."

Well, this one might work for you.
No, that's way too heavy a pan for me.
"Here, lift this aluminum pan. It's the same size."
No, I don't want this aluminum handle.
"Here's a similar aluminum pan. But it has a heat-resistant handle."
" Oh, this feels very nice. I'll take it."
"How much would you like to pay?"
Cash : I need a lid for this pan.
It sure is hot today.
Look at the traffic. It's terrible!

" I agree. It makes it difficult to breathe. "

"I have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place!"
There are a lot. Can you choose a favorite?
" Vanilla with toppings is my favorite. "
"Is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae?"
No, I like all flavors.
I don't like ice cream with too many different flavors in it.
" I agree with that, it just doesn't work for me. "
" I saw garlic ice cream on the menu once. "
"I think that would be horrible!"
"It is enough for today, do you have any last question?"
I got a good picture of the job and the company. All my questions have been answered.

He also was famous for never giving up on his goals.
He ran for office quite a few times before he was finally elected.
"And I also admire him for his courage in fighting for equal rights. "
He had great vision, didn't he?
I had a good day today.
"It was okay. "
No, I don't want a drink.
No thanks, I'm not thirsty.

Not really.
The narrator picked up the suits from the cleaners.
"Yes I did. "
" Yes, I am going to the pub tonight.
"Yes, I would like to go into a little more detail about the free services we can offer you. "
"I really am an absolute amateur when it comes to this stuff. "
No problem, we can provide a business licence, Enterprise ID Certificates, Forex registration and...
"what is forex trading?"
"I really don't know how to break this to you, but it's eating me alive!"
"Just tell the truth. I won 't take it personally. "
The narrator is sure he won 't lose control of himself.
"Sometimes it's wise to be direct with people. Come on, just tell me. Don't beat around the bush, please!"
Since you 'd like an honest answer, I will tell you the truth.
"I want to tell you something, but I don't know what it is "

"Good idea. My wife has a fine ear for music. I am sure she would like it."
"I think you made the right choice, coming to us.We have a wide selection of vehicles you can choose from."
"I would like to rent a car with a good stereo."
All our cars have stereos in them, air conditioning. It's all standard with us.
"Good. I am here visiting my girlfriend. I want her to have a good time."
"Oh, is that so? Well, then. Let me show you something she might like. It's on our back lot."
This is a Porsche!
" Yes. Beautiful, isn't it?"
"But I probably can't afford it. It must be really expensive."
"Well, sir. You said you were looking at cars at the rental agency at the airport.Now with them you'd spend your money and get nothing for it.But you could probably rent this Porsche from us, for the same price as one of their standard cars."
"I can't do that, because I'm not a doctor.
It's because our prices are so good. And this car has a lot of miles on it, but it's in nice shape, isn't it?
None of the above choices.
It's just some turbulence.
"I'm scared..."
"Yes, I am ready to go to the concert."
No, we should go by bus.
"Actually, why don't we go there by bike? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in rush hour."
"That's true. Cycling is good for our environment, too. Let me just get my helmet then."
Yes, it is comfortable.
Not really, but I liked the design so I got it.
"Maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better."
"I'll think about it. "

I can fix those for you. Is there anything else wrong with it?
The narrator does not know how to change the height of the saddle.
It's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle.

No, I'm fine.
" I'm fine. I'm just so touched by the sad story. "
So I can say now that you must have enjoyed the opera. Which scene is your favorite?
"I love them all, but if I had to name one as the best, I would say it's the ending."
I couldn't help falling asleep.
"Did you? I didn't notice that, but still you should know it, for you have seen it with Laura before."
" I guess I've done the same thing last time I was here with her, too. I mean falling asleep. For me, this one is not that attractive."
"Then I doubt if you like operas at all. "
"Yes. I like Carmen very much. But I don't mind if you want to tell me about this one. "
The man was old and he was visiting his wife's grave, with a rose in his hand. When he got there, he saw someone already put a rose on her grave.
"Very impressive. And I do like the leading actress who has an amazing voice. "
" Me, too. There was always a good round of applause every time she sings. "
Yes, the applause! That was what kept waking me up during the show.

" I think it's running late. "
"It should've been here 30 minutes ago."
It should be coming soon.
"It better, because I'm already late for work. "
" I can't stand riding the bus. "
" Me too, it's so unreliable. "
" That is true. "
"It's also horrible having to be at a bus stop in any kind of weather."

"I would work here for a long time."
"I would continue to work in the company as long as the job suits me well."
No, I do not expect a high salary.
"Hey, Taxi. Over here!"
"Yes, I called a car service."
Yes, I am engaged.
Not at the moment. Where would you like me to take you?
I am going to the airport, and I have to catch the 930 flight to New York.
"Well, it's a long way and there is roadwork near Broadway. I am not sure I can snake it in half an hour."
"But I can't miss the flight. It's an important meeting and it's waiting for me."
" All right, I will try my best. If there aren 't any holdups, I think we can get there in time."
"That's great. How much is it to the airport?"
About $ 25, tips not included.
"Fine. Will you please help me with the luggage?"
"Oh, yes, sure. Let me put it in the boot."
"Thanks very much. "
Not at all, please.
" Ok, let's hurry. "
"What day is it?"
It's Monday, October 27.
I'm leaving on November 10th.

No, I am fine.
I don't feel very good.
"I have some tablets for seasickness. "
" They give me no help at all. "

She must be a good wife.
No, this is only what she says.
Susan is the manager in this office.
No, he is meeting a client.
"Oh, that's too bad. I just got a phone call saying that my wife is now in the hospital. She is going to deliver a baby. I must take the day off to go to the hospital. May I talk to him to ask for leave?"
"I am afraid not, but I think I could convey your leave to him after the client goes."
Mary: I have found several companies that are hiring.
"Yes, I have found three companies."
"Yes, I have called to inquire about the positions. "
Yes, but the results are not so satisfying.
"What's the matter?"
"I asked the first company about the vacancy, but they had already hired someone."
"What a pity!"
The second one told me that the job information was released half a year ago, and had been overdue.
"It's frustrating!"
The last company is still hiring, but not recent graduates.
"Wonder why they do that!"
" I feel terrible now. "
"Don't be discouraged. Just keep trying and you will find a job eventually."
The ink is spilled on the desk.
No, it did not spill on my clothes.
No, but the table cloth was dirty.
"That's OK. "
"I'm afraid it's too hard to wash off the stain."
It's no big deal.
I really feel great shame. Let me buy a new one for you.
The best way to see the city is by foot.
"Sure, I advise the sightseeing buses."

The life expectancy in your country is.
I'm not sure, but probably about 75 years. How about in your country?
About 70, I think. This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population. It ’s a problem that will soon affect most of the world.
" I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age, because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly."
Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday.
"Did she? That's great, however, if we have too many children, that will have a bad effect on the environment."
He is doing well.
He's fine. Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays.
He 'll be a teenager before you know it!
I had mine when I was 24. that's a little young. I 'd suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties, or even in your early thirties if you have a good career.
Yes, I think you're right. I'm thinking about having a child, but not just yet.
Yes, there is a big generation gap between parents and their children in my country.
Parents usually try to discourage teenagers, but they don 't often succeed.
"Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country. Sometimes they give them too much freedom."
" This looks wonderful, Madame Culot. "
Yes, it is very nice. All our foreign visitors enjoy it. The food is wonderfully well-prepared. Let me know if you need any help with the menu.

Yes, terrine is a kind of meat pate.
Mmm. Maybe another time.

"Yes, sir. We promised that. "
"But have 2 - hour journey."
"What do you expect of the position?"
" I hope to apply my knowledge and experience on the job and make further improvement. "
"What do you think about occupational planning?"
It is quite important for all of us. Without clear goals, one may lose direction and cannot pave the way for their future.
"Tell me something about your goals. "
As a graduate, it may be more important to develop myself effectively in my future work. And whatever job I may take, I will make the best efforts.
"If confronted with a difficult task, what will you do?"
" I will make full use of the chance and get myself ready for the challenges all the time. "
No, I don't.

Zina: Hi, Dave. This is Zina.
Zina is a snake.
"I got your e-mail a couple of months back. "
"Yeah? Which one was that?"
The one that said, You're a creep. From me you won 't hear another peep. I hope you wreck your jeep.
"Excuse me sir. Is there anything I can do for you?"
Yes, I bought the can two days ago, but today I found that is beyond the guarantee period.
" That way they look longer. "
The narrator is describing what they are doing.
Put on mascara.
"Nasty. You'd better not rub your eyes."
I won't.
"What seems to be the problem?"
I have a really bad toothache! My cheek is swollen and I can 't eat anything.
Mmm. This doesn 't look too good. I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth. It's pressing against your molars and that's one of the reasons you are experiencing pain.
"Yes, the root and the nerve will have to be extracted. "
First we will take some x-rays to see what we're dealing with. I also noticed a small cavity up front here, so you are going to need a filling.
"I guess that's what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day."
"Yes, I can imagine having a million dollars."

"Rocky six is supposed to come out this Friday."
"Yeah, but I don't know if it is going to be any good."
"The only reason I want to see it is because I have seen the previous five."
True. Ok. Let's see it this Saturday.
"How about we hook up for lunch at 12:00, and then go see the movie afterwards?"
A stranger stops to help.
No, my engine is on fire!
"I think that's just steam. Your engine's overheated."
Yes, I know a lot about cars.
A little bit. I'll take a look if you want me to.
Thank you so much for stopping.
It's hot. Radiator's leaking. Looks like you were running her pretty hard.
"That must have been just before I got the speeding ticket."
No, I haven't had an accident recently.
"What do you do for a living?"
Hal: I ran into it a couple of weeks ago.
"I'm Akimbo. Nice to meet you, I guess."
" Hey, Akimbo, I wonder if you'd like to make a deal?"
"It's a deal..."
"I'd like to give you cash for the damage to your car. "
"I don't want my insurance company to pay for it."
I'd rather not. They'll raise my rates. It'll cost me more in the long run.
No, I don't care.
"Hell, I don't care. Just don'T submit a report to your insurance company."
John is coming to town.
Mary: Hi, Lily. Lily wanted me to buy her some things for the party.
The traffic is bad today.
It's pretty bad.
"Yeah. You can say that again. It ’s noisy too. "
"I'm sorry, is that bicycle yours?"
"Yes, it is. What about it?"
"I backed into it while I was trying to get into the parking lot."
"I see. "
I'm really sorry. I'll face the music.
The dialogue response of "Where did you hit it?" is:.
"Right here. See the scratch?"
The narrator would like to have dessert.
"What do you have?"
I have apple pie, ice cream, chocolate cake and fruit cocktail.
No, I can 't.
"Of course, I made the apple pie this morning, so it's lovely and fresh."
"I love your apple pie. It's delicious. Can I have another glass of lemonade as well?"
"Can you get it yourself, it's in the refrigerator?"
No, I don't want a drink.
Yes, I 'll have an ice tea.
No, I am not having any dessert.
"Well, let's have your firm order."
Yes, here is our offer, 30,000 skirts at 200 yuan per skirt, FOB New York. You will find our price comes in line with the prevailing market.
"Your price is rather high. We cannot accept it. Can you bring the price down a little?"
" In fact, if it weren't for our good relations, we wouldn't consider making you a firm order at this price."
I can't agree with you. We have quotation from other sources too. Their prices are lower than yours.
But you know our design is superior to any other products from other companies. In fact, there is no room to negotiate the price now. You should be aware that the production cost alone has doubled in the past year.
" How's it going?"
" I'm great. Thanks. "
"What do you need?"
I need to know if I have any fees to pay.
"Actually, you do owe some fees."
"How much do I owe?"
"Your fees total $ 235.13."
"That's crazy!"
"You need to pay these fees soon. "
"Yes, I can do that right now."
"Will you be paying with cash or check?"
"Happy birthday! Many happy returns ( of the day )."
Jordan: Hey, is that you? Long time no see!
I haven't seen you since orientation three months ago.
"Yeah, I think so! I pledged Phi Iota Alpha, so I'm living at the frat house now."
" Oh, so you're a frat boy now huh?"
I have been working a lot.
I'm still living at home and commuting to school. I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about. The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count.
"That sounds smart... but kind of boring."
It is, a little bit. I joined the Great Outdoors Club, though, which has been a lot of fun. We've gone on two camping trips already, and I've made some good friends.
The narrator has not decided on a major yet.
Definitely pre-med. What about you?
I still have no clue... but we don't have to declare a major till our sophomore year, so I've got time!
OK, take care!
"Which restaurant do you prefer?"
"I'd like to taste Mexican food. "
"Yes, it's on Baker Street."

"I'm sorry I can't bring better news, sir. The site is a disaster."
"That's what I was afraid of."
It is not only the earthquake, sir. But the mudslides. Much of the north half of the site has been covered over by mud.
Ivan told me there were no mudslides in that district. I thought all the mudslides were down in Chichitango.
"That's what we thought, sir. That's what the news reported. But there was one little mudslide in our district too. Right above our site."
"What bad luck! I wish we had never come to this country.But, if it isn't the strikes and the revolutionaries, it's the earthquakes.Our operations here are finished!"
"I'm sorry, sir. "
Ivan will be able to get out there in a few days.
Ivan should be there by tomorrow lunch if he leaves tonight.
Good, I want an estimate of damages as soon as possible.
"But sir..." is the dialogue response of "But sir..."
"Yes, Yuri?"
I wouldn't recommend sending Ivan now. Especially at night. The roads aren't safe.
No, the bridges are fine.
No, sir. The bridges are fine. But I've heard rumors that the revolutionaries are coming down from the mountains. There has been fighting, sir.
No, I didn't hear anything on the news.
The government controls the press here, sir. They don't want it reported.
"Oh, this is terrible, Yuri. Terrible! So we can't even assess the damages. How can we do business in this country? Either we're buried under mud, or we're in danger of getting kidnapped. No, I can't believe this mess!"
"I'm sorry, sir. "
"No, I'm not doing anything tonight."
No, nothing. Why?
Yes, I like western music.
Yes, I do, very much.
" Yes, I would like to go and listen to it. "
Good afternoon! Can I help you?
Yes, I would like to book a table for six for the next Monday.
Certainly, sir. At what time should we expect you?
At 6:30 on next Monday evening.
Western food
"Chinese food."
Sir, may I have your name, please?
Mr. Peter will book it under the name of Mr. Peter.

May I help you?
"Yes, I'm looking for Bob."
He is in a meeting with Phil.
May I help you?
"Yes, can you tell me how to use the phone in my room?"
Dial 10 first and then call the number you want.
"Let's play a little game. I 'll describe someone and you try to guess who it is. "
I'm really bored at the moment.
He's got blue eyes and curly brown hair.
moustache
He has a moustache, but no beard.
Mike : file_other> Mike: file_other>
"Yes, it is. You describe someone we both know. "
She's not very tall and she's quite plump. She's got blonde hair, but I don 't know what color her eyes are.
I don 't think I know anyone like that.
"Well, I don't find her attractive, but I'm sure you will disagree."
I like slim girls, so I doubt I would find a plump girl attractive. You 'll have to give me some more information.
She's got tiny feet and wears really unfashionable shoes. In fact, she wears unfashionable clothes too.
This doesn 't sound like anyone I know. I give up. Teel me who she is.
She's your mother!
How important do you think appearance is?
I think that unfortunately it's more important than a person's character. Advertising and stuff tells us that we have to be attractive. I think that's wrong, but that's the way the world is now.
I'm afraid you're right, I chose my girlfriend because she has a wonderful personality.
"Wow! What a beautiful scenic spot! It's so open and you can almost taste its fresh air. "
"You can see Guiling City from the top of the mountain. "

The bird is indigenous to Guiling, and an endangered species.

Hi! What are you watching?

The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims, to reduce the chances of accidents.

Yes, almost all the families have their own cars.
None of the above choices.
It is hard to find a parking place in the city. Besides, parking is quite expensive in the downtown.

I am always busy with this job, I feel tired.
"I had the same feeling when I first came to work here, but after a period of time, I feel better, I am sure you 'll get used to this busy job."
I also feel that work efficiency here is very high. and you have strong working ability and professional skill, it seems that you know all, that's really wonderful!

Jack: Hi, how are you doing?
" Just so-so. You're doing all right?"
"What about a drink?"
Sir, what else can I do for you?

No, sir. We already gave you a discount on each item.

I've just found a mouse in the house!
"Ow! Don 't shout so loud. Calm down. Please stop shouting and sit quietly down."
" I found a mouse in our house, a grown mouse running around the dinning room."
"Where is it now?"
It's under the couch.
" Now, move the couch around and turn it upside down. "
" Ok, I don 't want a mouse in our house. We have the tidiest house in the town."
"It's very kind of you to show me around. "
Not at all.
" I really don't know. "
"Let's walk around the lake first, shall we?"
Yes, that would be lovely.

No, it's the first time I've been here.

Nothing important. I've been working overtime lately.
"I work eight hours a day now. "
"how many hours do you work a week?"
No, I don't think I can afford it.
I don't care. I need money.
" Surely you'll be paid extra for overtime, but do you think it's really worth?"
Yes, I think so. When I work overtime I'm paid time and a half.
" Oh, yes. Money comes faster in that way than otherwise. "
But jobs with a lot of overtime are quite limited. Employers usually don't like to pay for overtime if they can manage.

"You and everyone else. It looks more like a camp-ground than a library."
" Well, the dorm's too noisy to study in, and I guess this place is too quiet. "
"Have you had any luck finding a topic for your paper?"
No. Prof. Grant told us to write about anything in cultural anthropology. For once I wish she hadn ’ t given us so much of a choice.
"Well, why not write about the ancient civilizations of Mexico. You seem to be interested in that part of the world. "
I am, but there is too much material to cover, and Grant only wants five to seven pages.
"So they limit it to one region of Mexico. Say the Yucatan. You've been there and you said it's got lots of interesting relics. "

Smells good! What's for breakfast?
"Well, since we are getting up so late, I decided to make a big breakfast!"
"Nice! Brunch!"

The narrator made some coffee.

"Looks good! I 'll squeeze us some fresh orange juice."

"What aisle is that?"
"You'll find it by the oatmeal and breakfast bars."
"I know where that is at."
"I need help finding a job. "
"No, I don't have any dishwashing detergent."
"That's over by the paper towels and toilet paper."
"I didn't even think about that. "
"That's where it is."
"Thank you so much for helping me. "

No it's not, it's just funny.
"Yeah, if you're a girl."
"Well, you just want to watch Dark Angel because of the hot girl."
" That's not true. Dark Angel is a good show."
It's story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits.
O. K., O. K. Let ’s forget it. There ’s a football game on too.
"Good morning, sir. Have a seat please."
"I would like to know the state of the residential property market right now because I have an apartment to sell "
In recent months, the demand for residential properties has become extremely high. The price of residential properly has risen almost twenty percent.
Since I have to go back to England within the next few months, I would like to sell my apartment as soon as possible.
I think it's a seller's market right now. What is your property's address?
Flat C 15 / F, Tong House, Tai Koo Shing.
3 bedrooms and 2 living rooms.
Its gross area is approximately 9 hundred square feet. There is one living room, one dining room, one master bedroom and two other bedrooms.
"What is the orientation and view of the speaker?"
It faces south with a hillside view.
The market price for Tong House is around five thousand Hong Kong dollars per square foot, but it also depends on the internal layout and condition of the house.
"I would like to ask for four point five million Hong Kong dollars. "
Sir, may I have your name and contact number?
My contact number is 2876543 2. My office number is 2123456 7.
May I ask you one more question? When will your property become available?
In about one month.

No problem.
I will introduce your property to our clients. When they want to see your property, I will give you a call.
It's raining again.

"Yes, of course. It seems made to measure."
"Well, that one fits me better. What's the price?"
Bob: I'm getting on in years.
"Yeah, I'm very worried about his health."
He looks tired all the time.

"What should I wear today?"
"It's chilly outside, so don't forget to put on your jacket."
The shirt is good.
The result of your lab test is good.
" When it comes to that, I have a lot to say. "
"Then say it. "
I tried to keep a poker face even though I was scared to death, then you guess what he said.
"That's just what I want to know. "
"I seldom heard the quarreling of her children. "
The narrator is trying to explain to the narrator why they say that.
Because her children have been the age when they seem to quarrel all day long.
She told me that she had learned very quickly how to pour oil on troubled waters, but not to pour oil on the flame.
The apartment comes unfurnished.
This one is. I have another one that's furnished, but I'm not sure you'll like the furniture.
What does the narrator need?
"This building is only four years old. It was built with central air."
"Just like in the States! That's perfect!"
"Yes, I would like to order dinner.
"Of course. What would you like?"
I want a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare.
I'm so sorry, we ran out of filet mignon. May I suggest the porterhouse instead?
"That's too bad, but the porterhouse will be okay."
May I be so bold as to suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne?
" Not tonight, thank you."
No strawberries. We'll charge your amenities account, if that's okay.
"Charge it to whatever account you like."
"No, I like it a lot.
I don't think this fish is fresh, it actually tastes a bit off.
"Sorry, Miss. I'll place it immediately, can I get you another drink, or you wait?"
No, please don't do that. I'd just like to return it.
I'm sorry, Miss, but I'm afraid we can't do that. You'll order something else instead. I'd love to suggest the steak, it's the special today, and quite tasty.
"Ok, then please bring me the steak medium-rare, thank you."
"Waiter, I would like to order now."
"What do you want to eat today?"
"Cream soup and steak, please "
None of the above choices.
"Excuse me, what does that mean?"
Well, there are several kinds of steaks. For example, you can have your steaks medium-rare, medium-well or well-done.
"I'm afraid of the dark. "
"Don't worry. I'll drive you back."
"We're lucky today. "
There aren't any clouds in the sky and we've got such a beautiful view here. Look! This is St James Park and there's Buckingham Palace.
Hyde Park is in London.
"It's on the other side of the Palace. "
"That's the place where people make speeches on Sundays, isn't it?"
Yes, you're right. Politicians of all kinds, religious people and one or two madmen.
No, we are not going there today.
" Sure. I can see you're enjoying your trip today. "
" How many hours do you work a week?"
I usually start work at 8 a. m. and finish at 4.

The trash of the world he sets high price upon, but the heavenly things he shamefully undervalues.

"Who was elected?"
McCain won the election.

" That doesn 't make any sense. "
" I have more bad news. "
"How could the news get any worse?"
" I was only kidding, because Obama won the election."
no
Not really. Sometimes, I even let other people make key decision.
None of the above choices.
I let my parents make big decisions for me. They chose my university and my course. I ended up studying something.
Mak's parents will be choosing your girlfriend if you aren 't careful.
We are going to a bar this evening.
I can 't make a decision. You 'll have to put forward an idea.
ok, i choose luckies.
" I'm terribly nervous. "
"Steven, I am ready for breakfast."
It is in the coffee shop.
It's in that pan there. Your boy Dean broke the silex yesterday, so I have to boil it in the pan.
"It tastes like crankcase oil, but delicious."
"That's good. You can make breakfast yourself if you don't like it."
"What is there besides coffee?"
"I warmed a couple of snails, and your eggs are in the frying pan."
It's nearly eight, I have no time to have breakfast now. My watch says seven fifty.
It's only ten to seven. You must have forgotten to set your watch back.
Yes, it was. The clock on the wall says eight to seven.
"Yeah. Keep on eating your breakfast. You can catch the early bus."
May I come in?
"Come in please."
Sir, what's the matter?
The toilet doesn't flush.
"Let me see.En.. it's right now.You can try it."
"Wonderfull. Thanks a lot."
"I heard there was an accident today. "
"Nobody told me what happened?"
"Tell me the news. "
A truck turned over on the freeway.
"Are you kidding?"
"I am completely serious. "
No, no one was hurt.
" I believe that two people did get hurt. "
No, the injuries were minor.
" I believe so. "
" That's great to hear. "
" I 'd like to go to a country-and-western singer tonight. "
" I 'd enjoy that. "
"I'll pick you up around 8: 00."

The dialogue response of "856674." is:
"That's right.
OK, I'll get someone to phone you first thing in the morning.
I thought it was a good movie.
I didn't like it. Not a bit. I couldn't stand the music. Besides the story was so boring that it put me to sleep.
I noticed that, it was not exciting as I expected, but the music was great. I'm always found Jazz. And that movie had a lot of Jazz.
I know, however, jazz always annoys me. I really don't enjoy music in a movie.
"What kind of movie do you like?"
"I like thrillers and chillers. "
" Oh, I see. "
"Well, I enjoy the popcorn and being with you.You're more important than the movie."
"Thanks for the sweet words. "
No, the steak was recommended, but it is not very fresh.
"Oh, sorry to hear that. This is quite unusual. I will look into the matter."
This is very annoying.
I'm sorry, sir. Do you wish to try something else? That would be on the house, of course.
No, I don't risk it.
"Yes, I would like a delicious dessert with our compliments. "
I'm not keen on dessert as a habit. They are fattening.
"Excuse me, can you show me the cloisonn bracelet in the counter?"
"Sure. Let me get it for you. "
"Yes, I can also show you this one."
No problem, this one is made of pure gold.

" You're right, this one costs less, but is more beautiful."
No, the luster will last a long time.
No, we guarantee the quality.
"Ok. Can I try it on?"
"How much does this cost?"

"Channel 2"
All three candidates are presenting their campaign platforms.
" I used to be really interested in that. But lately it seems that they end up saying one thing and doing another anyway. So why listen?"
If nobody listened that would be like turning our backs on our own rights and obligations to the freedoms that our forefathers fought for.
It's not that serious.
The narrator thinks that if nobody paid attention to anything then what's it all for anyway?
There is nobody here.

I overheard this information when I passed Arden's office. We got some complaints from consumers yesterday. I am terribly sorry about that.
"I actually checked them one by one. How could this be?"
"It is useless to act like that. Can we find some solutions?"
"What can I do now? I nearly go crazy now. "
Arden can't be found.
" It seems that I have nothing to do, except this."
"Where's the nearest bank?"
I'm glad you could find time to meet with me, Mr. Johnson. I can 't think of a nicer environment for our meeting today, the ambiance here is lovely!
No problem, if possible I always combine business with pleasure. Now, let ’s hear more about these chocolates you ’re offering.
I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States. They're a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market. Naturally, your restaurant sprung into my mind immediately. I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant, luxurious, first class dining.
The chocolates are produced in Belgium.
The factory is located in Scotland.
"Really? I didn 't think they were known for their luxury chocolate production"
The government is one hundred per cent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units. They've also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well. Here, I brought these especially for you, try one!
Mmm, hmm, creamy texture, very smooth...
I bet you've never tasted anything like it! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one's cutting corners with the ingredients. Only the creme make it through inspection.
No, it's not spicy.
"I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations. Buttermilk, cacao beans, sugar and Haggis."
Haggis is a Scottish dish.
It's a traditional Scottish delicacy, you take sheep's liver, heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep stomach.
"Ah, get back to you. "
"Hello, this is my passport."
"What's in your bags?"
"Those are gifts I bought for my friends."
"No, I don't want to open it."
3
Two adults and one kid.
"for buffet?"
No, I don't charge for it.
Thirty for each adult, twenty each kid.
I see. Where can I get the food?
"Please go to the tables over there for cold dishes and vegetables. The hot dishes are on the other side."
no
May Flower Restaurant, please.
"Just a second... Sorry, the line is engaged."
OK, I 'll try later. Thanks anyway.
Mr Williams is from America.
"Yes, I am. "
Li Ming: I'm Li Ming from CITS.
Come on in. Let me show you around. Here ’s the living room.
The view from this window is wonderful.
This is the kitchen.
"It looks new. "
Yes, we just renovated a few months ago.
" I like it. "
Here's the master bedroom.
It's nice, but what about the rent?
"how much is a month in rent?"
No, it does not include utilities.
Yes, it includes electricity, water, gas and cable but the telephone is extra.
It will be available in a few months.
The end of this month.
I like it a lot but I need to talk with my wife. Can you hold it for me for two days?
"Sure..."
"Congratulations! Mr. Stuart! You won the city marathon. "
" Thank you. I am very excited. "
"We are all very proud of you. "
"I am very happy, too. It was a big game and I won. "
" I watched the race with my children. We saw you run to the finish line. We all screamed with excitement."
No, I don't know.
"How do I get to the Olympic Stadium, please?"
It's not far. Go straight on then turn right at the end of the road.
Fill it up with regular, please.
No, I don't think so.
No, thanks. I'm in a hurry.
Oh, no. It looks like my computer really has caught a virus.
No, I did not open an attachment.
George W. Bush : An hour later, all I see are pictures of George W Bush in women's clothes.
He looks better that way, doesn't he? More presidential.

"I work from 8 am to 5 pm. "
From 9 to 12 a. m. and 2 to 6 p. m.
"Yes, I can ask for a leave "
"Of course, if necessary."

" If I have a chance, I'll enjoy the book. "
"Yes, I would like to go to the bookshop with you.
"Excuse me, could you tell me how much is the lipstick?"
"It costs only 25 yuan."
The narrator can 't make it any cheaper.
The price is reasonable because the quality is super.
"But the price is too high."
" How much would you like it to be, then?"
"What about 15 yuan?"
"Let's meet half way, 20 yuan, OK?"
" All right, I'll take it. "
" I think you've got a real bargain. "

"Yes, I interned at a company in New York. "
"Yes, I interned with an accounting firm during tax season."
" That must have been stressful. "
"Yes, but I learned a lot. "
I'll bet.
No, I am not engaged.
No, sir. Can I help you?
"I want sharing company. "
"Good morning. Can I help you?"
"Good morning. I'd like to make a reservation to Guangzhou for August 2. "
"I'm sorry, sir. There is no ticket available on that day. But we have flights for Guangzhou the next day."
A 9:12 flight in the morning and a 14:00 flight in the afternoon.
The plane will reach for the morning flight at 7 o'clock.
"At 13:15. "
OK. I'd like to book a ticket for this one.
No, my company did not go union.
Yes, we're hopping on the bandwagon and signing up for the union. Mostly people are pretty happy about it... I guess it depends on if you are in management or in the labor force.
Management isn't looking on the labor unions too favorably, I guess... labor unions can really put the squeeze on the executives.
" Hello, I would like to make an appointment to look at houses. "

"It was me. I am so sorry."
"What did you think you were doing?"

Rose: The weekend is coming. Let's discuss what we will do.
"What about going to the zoo on Saturday and to the park on Sunday?"
"Sounds good. But on Saturday there's a football final."
Then, what shall we do on Sunday.
Let me see. We can visit the country. We haven't done that for such a long time.
I will go shopping in one of the department stores nearby. We'll go to the zoo and the park another time. After all, we can put that off.

Ryan : Hi, I'm Ryan.
Malia: I need to call in sick today.

I went hiking and have terrible poison oak.
When did you get that?
"I think I got it on Saturday, but it just showed up today."
The narrator is doing research for it.
The doctor prescribed an ointment and gave me a shot.
"The portions here are man sized. We usually end up taking half of the meal home with us."
Yes, I would recommend it.
" Hey, sis. You know me, if I don't like everything on the menu, I don't go back to the restaurant!"
"So you're saying I can't go wrong with anything I order?"
"Wait, you love salmon, don't you?"
No, it does not come with a soup.
"Soup and bread and salad bar! I'm telling you these people know how to keep you coming back!"
Steven: I'm going abroad by plane for the first time tomorrow. Can you give me some advice? And what should I pay attention to?
First, you should have enough sleep to get over the jet lag before the departure. Most people will suffer from jet lag for a few days after a long flight.
" I will go to bed early tonight. "
No, I'm fine.
I don't know. But I have a carsickness.
"You'd better bring some medicine for airsickness."
It was a good day.
The salmon is good toady, it's very fresh.
"It is done with a computer. "
It's cooked with lemon and savored with rice.
"Sound nice, I will try it."
"Your meal also include soup and salad."
"What's for dinner?"
French onion soup, sir
No, I don't like coffee.
No, thanks. I have some trouble with my heart, my doctor recommend I to drink less.
No, I don't like watermelon.
My brother gave me a baby cat yesterday. I can keep it as my pet.
I don 't understand why you want a cat.
Cats are beautiful and lovely, aren 't they?
No, cats are too dirty. They are lazy and cunning. I don 't like them at all.
I don 't think so, I think cats are sweet.
I am told that you dance like an animal. Why don 't you give a show in the front stage?
"What's wrong with you?"
I have had a low fever these days.
"Don't worry. I'll write you a prescription for a new medicine that works wonders."
" I'd like to have steak and a beer. "
well-done
"I'd like a refund on this sweater."
May I have a look at your receipt?

About how much will it cost?

"Yes, I can help you, sir."
Yes, I want to rent a formal suit for an interview.
Yes, you should rent a brown suit and a black shirt.
May I try this on?
May I know where you are going?
Yes, I want to go to Beijing Hotel.
"I'm sorry. You are going in the wrong direction. "
"What shall I do?"
"Don't worry. You can get off at the next stop and go across the street through the overpass. The bus stop is right there."
" I don't understand why some parents keep beefing and complaining about their daughters not being able to follow suit. "
Li Na's mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbour's daughter got married with a Canadian.
"If I were Li Na, I would ask her if she had done that."
No, I don't know.
"Yes, it is my handbag."
"Pardon?"
"Yes, it is my handbag."
"So, now we have covered all the important points. "
Yes, I think so.
" Before we draft the contract, let's examine the details. "
"Ok, under this contract, we 'll supply you with 600 dozen T-shirts, S, M and L equally assorted, at USD 100 per dozen, CFR London. Shipment in July. Payment by irrevocable sight LC."
"Perfect. But what I'm concerned about most is the time of delivery "
"You may rest assured that shipment will be effected within the time limits stipulated in the contract, but there is also one point I 'd like to stress."
No, I don't know.
"Your LC must be opened at least one month before the time shipment, otherwise we won't be able to catch the ship."
No problem. I 'll have the covering LC opened as soon as I wetback. In addition, would you tell me by whom the commodity inspection is conducted before shipment?
The goods will be inspected by the China Import & Export Commodity Inspection Bureau. It will then issue a certificate of quality and a certificate of weight. These will be taken as final and bidding.

I have to have at least eighteen to keep my scholarships and grant. But so far, I only have fifteen.

No, I haven't.
" Honey, I think I need to go see the doctor. "
The narrator is bleeding all over.
"I was working in the garage and cut myself with my saw. "
No, it does not hurt.
No, not really, there's just a lot of blood.
I think they can handle this at the clinic instead of the ER. Let me make a quick phone call.
"I'm going to go sit in the car while I still have the stomach to walk."
I want to open an account.
bank account
I want to open a checking account.
"Do you know the minimum balance you're required to keep?"
"How much is that?"
"You have to maintain a minimum balance of $ 100."
"Yes, really. "
I can 't meet that requirement.
"You will be fined."
"How much is the fine?"
"Here comes the bus. I'll call you up later."
None of the above choices.
I am a girl of many interests. I like dance, chess, collecting stamps, travelling and taking photos.
None of the above choices.
" I like rumba and tango "
I am not interested in Chinese chess, it is too difficult for me.
"You can learn Chinese checkers or military chess. Both of them are much easier."
The narrator thinks stamp collecting is an expensive hobby.
None of the above choices.
I like gardening. I take care of them everyday. I like those flowers and the swing in my garden. If the weather is nice, I would like to lie on the lawn.
Mom, I want to move out.
I found a job.
"Job?"
Yes, job. If you ’re going to live on your own, you have to pay for rent and everything else.
"I thought I could just get you and Dad to pay for an apartment. I found a cheap one."
When you move out, your father and I aren 't paying your rent, young man. Get a job.
" If I'm going to live on my own, I have to be independent. "
Mom, I didn 't have breast. I could eat a horse.
"Come in, Arnold. Have a seat."
"Good morning. "
"Yes, I'd like a cup of coffee.
No, thank you. I just had two cups of coffee at my desk.
So, you're a serious coffee drinker.
Yes, it keeps me going. Sometimes I think I'm addicted.
The narrator is a cigar smoker.
No, I've tried them. But I'm not really a smoker.
"What would you like to talk to me about?"
"I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal. "
"I'm glad when people have new ideas around here. Tell me about it."
"You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday?"
"Yes, I do. "
"Well, I have been thinking about it. And I believe we could do things more efficiently here."
"What do you suggest?"
The way it is now, the staff from all four branches get together once a week. We meet for one hour. But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation.
"You mean because people have to go across town to get here?"
Some people spend half of the morning on the road.
" That's true, but our staff meetings are very important, Arnold. I don 't know how we can function without them."
"I think they are important too. That's why I want people to have a better attitude about them."
" I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful. I'm aware of that."
" Here's what I propose. I think we should meet once every two weeks, but meet for ninety minutes or more. "
"Well..."
"I also think the meetings should be more focused. And I would be willing to take responsibility for that."
The narrator wants to run the meetings.
Yes, I could help organize them. I could discuss meeting topics with you, and then prepare a schedule for each meeting. I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.
Hmm. But we would meet every two weeks.
" I really think it would work. The meetings could be longer, and better organized."
I am not against the idea, Arnold. It may really be more efficient, as you say. I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month, and see how it works.
" I would be happy to get started on it. "
"Look out!"
"What's it?"
"You must have rolled over something just now."
"Hello, you seem a little lost. Can I help you?"
"I've got a Remittance Advice and I'd like to cash it."
I can do that for you. Could I see the Remittance slip?
"I'm here on business and this is from my boss, it's for my expenses so I need cash."
No, it is 2,000 RIB.
Yes, that's right.
"I just need to see some identification before I hand over the cash."
Me! I've already logged in 20 hours of overtime!
I thought they were getting you an assistant.
"They were supposed to, but so far nobody's turned up, and I've been left on my own to do the work. This is the first break I've had all day."
"Yes, we can stay out all night "
No way.
"But we'll be careful.
"Hello, Bobby, It seems that I can't arrive at your home by 12 o'clock."
"We're all waiting for you, Hans, Dick, Archie..."
I'm so sorry, I've been held up by the damn traffic jam for half an hour. I'd have arrived but for that.
Li is at home.
"Thirty meters ahead is the Waterloo Bridge."
It's not far away from home, It's - let me see – about 20 minutes' walk, Can you walk here?
"What can I do with my car? If only I had taken a taxi!"
"That's too bad, But don't worry. We 'll put off dinner till one o'clock."
"I'm so terribly sorry to keep you waiting. "
"It doesn't matter. Bye."
"What time do you go to school in your country?"
"Five days a week, too?"
"Actually, five and a half. On Saturday, we have classes only in the morning."
Gosh!
" That's too much for us really. "
The narrator is going now.
"I'm going to try to find out where the school is located."
"When do you start school?"
"I'm going to register right now. "
Cindy likes her eggs scrambled.
"Sunny-side up, please."
The toaster is over there on the kitchen counter. Help yourself.

"I think I'll have two slices of whole wheat."
Cindy: Can you go wake up Cindy for me?
"Sure..."

"I'll show you around and explain the operations as we go along. "
"That'll be most helpful."
"Maybe we could start with the Design Department. And then we could look at the production line."
"How much do you spend on design development every year?"
About 10 % of the gross sales.
Yes, I should start the car.
Fittipaldi: I'm ready to start the car.
"Let's get going already! I'm ready!"
"Good, now accelerate gently and let go of the clutch as you do it. There we go, good!"
I'm driving! This is awesome! Let's turn some music on!
I said the brakes!
This is just like playing video games!
It's the police! Pull over!
"Yes, I would like to ask the company for the housing."
"Yes, but now we are fresh out of staff quarters."
The narrator will try to solve the problem.
He came to work late every day that week, then on Friday he didn't show up at all.
"Where to, sir?"
Beijing University is located in Beijing.
No, of course. I live near the university. Hop in please.
"Yes, I'd like someone to help me with my luggage."
" Okay, we'll put it in the trunk. Ah, it is so heavy."
Yes, I packed my books in it. Thank you.
"I am rejoiced to tell you that you are employed. "
Thank you for hiring me. I'm very proud to be employed by your firm.
"Yes, I will be there."
"Well, Mr. Brooks. I'm sorry, again, for the delay, but we should have everything completed by the time you get back."
" I certainly hope so. Can we arrange to meet on the 27th? That should give you enough time. "
"Yes, sir. That's more than enough time. I do appreciate your understanding. Why don 't we say 10:00 o'clock on the 27th?"
I need help picking out a lotion.
"What do you need help with?"
I picked up some poison oak while hiking, and I can 't stop itching.
Techne, lotion or cream.
No, I find that one works better than the other
" I have heard that the cream is longer lasting. "
"Yes, there is a cream that can help with itching "
If you take an antihistamine, that would help a lot.
"Thank you for helping me figure out what to do with my poison oak. "
I'd like to open a savings account. Can you tell me how to do it?
OK. You have to fill out this form and let me see three identification cards or documents.

"You can deposit an initial amount of ten dollars "
Chris: Hey there Chris, what are you up to?
"I'm just poring over some brochures about various car models."
The narrator is thinking about buying a new car.
I thought we could probably survive without one, but with a baby on the way, maybe it is time to get a car.
So this would be your first automobile?
For quite a few years, I rode a bicycle to work. Then I got a motorbike.
"Yeah, I think I can understand your wife's position. Asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she's pregnant is a tall order."
She takes the bus to work, but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it is crowded and hot.
So it's time to buy your very first car! Wow, that's exciting!
"Yes, but it's also a pretty big financial responsibility."
I still remember my first car. It was an old clunker that my dad gave me when I was 17. I drove it around for a couple of years until I scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car.
"I'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us."
Yes, I am looking for a sedan.
Yes, I'd like a Jeep, but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives.
"Steven, I need badly your help."
"What's the matter?"
My wife has found that I have an affair with my secretary, and now she is going to divorce me.
How could you cheat on your wife? You have been married for ten years.
"Yes, I know I'm wrong. But I swear that the affair lasts only for two months. And I still love my wife. I couldn't live without her."
"I will try my best to persuade her to reconsider the divorce. But are you sure that from now on you will be faithful to her forever?"
"I'm looking for black pumps to go with my evening gown. Could you show me what you have?"
High heeled shoes.
" Not to high, maybe an inch or an inch in the half would be the best."
I might have just the pair for you. Look at these, they were made in Italy, the leather is very soft, so your toes will not get pinched.
"Yes, I do, they are size six.
Yes, we do, we also have this same style in dark blue and red.
No, thank you. I'm just looking for a black pair.
"Yes, I can help you.
"I'd like to buy a ticket to Casablanca on flight US125 tomorrow."
"Hold on, plese. It will take off at 14:00 tomorrow. The price is $ 110."
Well, I want to stay under $ 100.
Jon Dahl Green: Welcome to our company. Jon Dahl Green: I'm in charge of the export department.
"I'll give you mine too. "
The flight was fine.
" Not bad, but I'm a little tired. "
After this meeting, we will visit the factory and have another meeting with the production manager, and you'll be having dinner with our director.

"Of course, I've arranged it at 10 0 'clock tomorrow morning."
"Well, shall we get down to business '."
"Yes, I received it last week.
Yes, we finished the evaluation of it. If the price is acceptable we would like to order now.
"I'm very glad to hear that. "
"What's your best price for that item?"
The unit price is $ 12.50.
"I think the price is a little high, can't you reduce it?"
"I'm afraid we can't. $ 12.50 is our rock bottom price. If you purchase more than 10,000 units we can reduce it to $ 12.00."
"Well, I'll accept the price and place an initial order of 10,000 units."
" It's been a pleasure to do business with you, Mr. Smith. "
The pleasure is ours. Can you deliver the goods by March 31?
"What would my new duties be?"
"What is your main responsibility at work?"
no
"Watch out!"
"Will you tell me the situation?"
" I was in my friend's room talking for an hour or so. "
"And then?"
"I came back to my room and found my suitcase was open and my camera and five hundred dollars in cash inside the wallet were gone."
No, I am not insured.
"Yes, this is my overseas travel accident insurance card."
"What would be my daily duties?"
Your job includes paper filing a lot. Anc you will have to check and fill the stationer cabinet regularly. Besides, you have to reserve the meeting room in advance if there are any important visitors.
The narrator should report it to the police.
"Excuse me, waiter, I would like to have some wine before the main course."
"Have you decided what wine you would like?"
I have no idea. Maybe you can give me some advice.
I recommend you the white wine. It will wake up your appetite.
I need to get some business cards printed up.
Do you know how many you need?
"I think I can get by with 2,000. "
"We can get started as soon as you fill out this form."
"I hope you can make the new cards just like my old cards. "
"You won't be able to tell the difference with a magnifying glass."
" Okay, I'm through. Here's the form and my old card."
Very good. You can pick up your order in one week.
Three days is better than seven.
"Excuse me, Ma'am. I would like to mail this package door to door via airmail to London. It is a very important package and has to be sent within 3 days."
No problem, but the postage is much higher than the regular package.
"That's fine with me. I am willing to pay for it as long as you can guarantee me the package can arrive in time."
OK, all registered airmail packages can be received in 5 working days.
I need to pay in total for this package.
"It's 500 dollars "
"Can I have the receipt? Just in case something goes wrong. "
"Sure! Please just fill in your I. D. number and ways to contact you here."
Yes, you need to include your zip code in the address.
"You had better include that because it is easier for the mailmen to find the correct mailing address."
"Thank you very much. Here is 500 dollars."
"When in Rome, do as the Romans do, they say."
"What do you mean?"
Roman is living in Rome, of course. And go to work by car, or bus or on foot.
" I think the Romans do what everyone else does. "

"Yes, I did a lot of fun things over the weekend "
I didn't want to go out last weekend, so I decided to stay at home and watch a movie.

I was very tired after working all week. Sometimes on the weekend I don't have enough energy to go out to a movie theater.
"Did you rent it at the store?"
No, I don't know.
"Yes, I'd like one more blanket."
I'm afraid there aren't any left at the moment. Gan you wait just a little while?
OK. I will.

"Yes, I'd like a cup of tea.
"Mary, there's one more thing that you must do for me before you leave."
"What is it?"
"You have to take the math and English evaluation tests."
The narrator is trying to figure out why he's not getting the results he wants.
Because you're from a foreign country, the school needs to find out how good you are at both basic skills.
"It's so that I can be put into the right math and English classes, right?"
"You are a smart girl!"
"Yeah, I've just moved here, and I 'd like to activate my cell phone, and I'm not sure if I should go with a prepaid plan, or a monthly rate plan."
This phone can 't be used in the US, it's not compatible with our 3G network.
I don 't really want to have to buy a new phone.
" Well, you see, if you sign up for our three-year plan, we 'll throw in a handset for free."
"What's the catch?"
No catch! You just choose a plan, sign a three-year contract and, that's it! Actually, we're running a special promotion right now, and we're giving away a Blackberry Curve with our special Mega Value forty dollar plan.

None of the above choices.
He has his own company, and it's not going very well.
"Well, I hate to say this, but I'm not surprised.
"Really? What makes you say that?"
He doesn't look very honest.

The narrator asks how to pay for it.
"Well, the website handles a point system where if the seller does something wrong people comment negatively and then you know that he or she may not be trustworthy."
No, you don't need a credit card.
They also let you use the Paypal system which is really safe and fast. I have never had any problems with someone hacking my information or anything.

"Both my items will fit under the seat or in the overhead bin."
"You will need to send the tripod as luggage because it is too long to fit in our gauge box for carry-on items."
"No, we cannot guarantee that it will not be damaged if I check it in."
No, I can't. Perhaps your stewardess will help you to find a place to store it.
No, I don't want to.
I can't, I have to go to the gym.
Come on! You can go tomorrow, just skip it today. It's not as if you are gonna get in trouble!
"Actually I will! I am working out with a personal trainer that gets on my case if I don't go. I like it, because it makes me feel more obligated to go and get healthy."
"Yes, he basically teaches me how to work out."
He makes a work put plan depending on the areas I want to work on, or the muscles I want to build. Like for example in order to get better muscle tone in my abs, pecs and biceps, he makes me work out with free weights. Then for my quads, calves and hamstrings, I do leg lifts or squats.

No, I don't have a choice.
" You look great! "
"Thanks to you. I'm totally pumped up. "
So you are happy that you made the decision to join us.
" I surely am. But still there is one single problem. "
"What's that?"
" I eat more and more these days. And it puts even more weight on me. "
It's not good to start with too much work-out at the beginning. What about trying something else?
I'd love to do that. What do you recommend?
"Yes, I would like to try it.
Yes, it is a good option.
It takes great perseverance to master.
"I can do that. "
"Here is a free class going on right over there. Go and join them."

Yes, I am feeling better now.
"Much better now. Thanks again."
It doesn't look very nice outside today.
" I think it's going to rain later. "
In the middle of the summer, it shouldn't be raining.
"That wouldn't seem right."
Considering that it's over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird.
It would be nice if it started raining, it is too hot.
" I know, you're absolutely right. "
" I wish it would cool off one day. "
" That's how I feel, I want winter to come soon."

"Maybe we can come here again next summer."

"You can't charge me for a mistake that I made!"
" Sometimes you can't win for losing, sir. "
"What a rip-off this place is!"
I see myself three years from now.
"What is your dream job?"
B
No, I rarely work overtime.
Yes, I have to work overtime a lot due to the editing job.
"Yes, there is extra pay for that.
"Thanks for everything. "
" Now darling, I know that we've bought this house together, but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it. I think we should sell it."
" Oh, no, Nathan, I really think we've bought this flat at the right time, you know. Market prices are going to go up, and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more."
"But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating. I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished."
"I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely."
"Well, only you liked it really, darling."
"I wonder if we can change to Channel 26. "
"I'd like to see what's on that channel "
A lecture on how to make stir-fried ginger beef, not the boxing you like.
" I hope the food here is good. "
" Yes, it is very expensive. Maybe we shouldn't have come here."
"If we are spending three days in Hollywood, I want to see at least one star."
" I think we might not see any. "
No, I didn't like it.
I thought it was OK, but it really was too hot. And I think they should show people more. The exhibits should be more interesting.
I thought it was great. Didn't you like the special effects rooms?
"Daniel. Mind your eye!"
"May I see a hat, please?"
"What size do you take?"
"I'm sorry. I don't know. "
I'll measure you... You take size 6. What colour hat would you like?
Brown : file_photo> Brown : file_photo> Brown : file_photo>
"Here are some nice brown hats. Try this hat on. It's a very good one."
"Yes, I like this one. It goes very well with my coat."
"Yes, I have a certificate of technical qualifications and a license. "
Yes, I have received an Engineer's Qualification Certificate and a driver's license.
"I have had my driver's license for a few years now."
"I have two years driving experience. "
The narrator has special skills.
"I have experience in computer operation, proficiency in Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel."
"What computer languages have you learned?"
"what is vc++?"
"Yes, I have gotten special training in programming. "
No, I do not take vitamin pills regularly.
No, I don't, do you?
Maybe you should do it too. You may not get enough vitamins from your food, you know.
But, I don't believe in taking pills to get enough vitamins.
"How's that.?"
"Yes, I would like to know about benefits and so forth."
Everyone enjoys hearing the benefits of something!
"With this agreement we can bring over you many benefits. For example, head offices of your group companies can get really prompt integrated fund transfers and centralised allocations. This helps internal supervision and admin run smoothly."
" That is wonderful. Our internal accounts seem so messy at the moment, nothing is running smoothly and it's costing us time and money. "
"Good afternoon, Peace Hotel, what can I do for you?"
Bobby: I have made a reservation for this Sunday.
Yes, that's right. Your room is a single one with a bath.
"I am calling to cancel it now. I can't go to your city this week."
"Fine, we will cancel it."
It's dangerous. I don 't dare to go.
" You're not going to believe what happened today. You've got to promise to keep it to yourself. "
The narrator is not sure what to do.
Mr. Leo threw Sally out of class today.
"On the level?"
Sally got her final test results back from Mr. Leo and started yelling at him.
" That's no laughing matter. That means she 'll have to take the whole course again. "
"Sorry, I can't find my seat on the plane."
Follow me and I will lead you to your seat.
"Yes, I'll put it in the overhead bin for you. "
"Of course..."
"Could you do me a favour? I don't understand this French document."
"What's the matter, dear?"
"Something awful happened. We went to the Portobello Road and someone stole my handbag."
The narrator lost a lot of money.
No. Only a few pounds. But my passport was in the bag. That ’s what I ’ m really worry about.
"You must tell the embassy about it. And I think they 'll issue you with a new one."
" I 'd better go tomorrow. "
I had a busy morning.
"What did you do?"
I watered all the plants.
" You have a lot of plants. "
"Then I did my laundry. "
"That takes some time."
I took the dog for a walk.
" I'll bet he enjoyed his walk. "
I vacuumed the entire house.
" That's a lot of work. "
"And then I made lunch."
"Excuse me. Can I ask you a question?"
"Sure. What is it?"
"I don't know how to say it in English. "
"We call this a parking meter."
"Oh, Thank you. But how do you spell it?"
"Hello?" is the dialogue response of "Hello?"
Tina: Hey Tina. What are you doing?
I was just watching TV.
" I just watched a movie and I'm scared. "
"What did you watch?"
I saw the Sixth Sense. I didn't know it was going to be so scary.
"I remember that. It was a great movie. But it was definitely scary."
" If you're not busy, do you want to come over? I'm afraid to be alone."
I can come over. What should we do?
"I need something to get my mind off the frightening images I have from the Sixth Sense."
" Ok. I'll get ready and leave. I'll see you in about 20 minutes."
Hurry, ok. It's dark out.
"Don't worry, nothings going to happen. I'll be there real soon."

The rent for this apartment is four or five.

"Hello, ABC Company. "
Mr. Wang's office is on the second floor.
He is out in a meeting now.
Mr Smith will be back in a few hours.
He will be back at about five in the afternoon.
Yes, Please tell him I called and ask him to return my call as soon as possible. It's about the PPT contract.
None of the above choices.
Cartons. Is that okay?
" I'm concerned about the possible jolting, squeezing and collision that may take place when these cases are moved about. "
"Well, what I can tell you is this. We've got an excellent record on making deliveries to our customers. Besides, all our cartons are lined with shockproof cardboards and are wrapped up with polyethylene sheets. So they're not only shockproof but also dampproof."
In that case, I guess I can rest assured.
"Well, I guess you can say that. The safety of packing is something we always pay a lot of attention to. Especially for those fragile commodities, we've got to be extra careful. Otherwise, if the things we don't want to see happened, we would be responsible and that'll cause you a lot of inconvenience, too."
It would be safer to use wooden cases.
"We sure can, but the charge will be much higher."
"It wouldn't be worth the trouble in that case, would it? Let's still use cartons."
"I would like to buy one round trip plane ticket to Hong Kong, please."
"For how many days, madam?"
"Leaving on September 5th and returning to New York City on October 9th."

"Wow that's great news! They're a great couple!"
Alex's best man is organizing the bachelor party It's gonna be so much fun! All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we are going to do that night.
I don 't want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it's your friends party.
Aw come on! It ’s just some innocent fun! You know how these things are! We are gonna play drinking games, get him some gag gifts and just have a good time. Nothing too over the top.
Well, I don 't know.
Come on! If one of your friends was getting married I wouldn 't mind you going to her bachelorette party!
Wendy is getting married and I'm organizing her party!
" I'm looking forward to our son's graduation this weekend. "
He really needs to go to college.
"Well, dear, we can't force him to go to college. It's up to him."
No, I am busy with my work.
"Yes, what about you?"
Yes, I'm very busy, too. Sometimes I work overtime.
"Then your salary must be high."
"Just so so. But we can travel twice every year."
No, it is not one of them.
Yes, we won't travel again until October.
I can 't decide what to do today.
Let's go swimming.
" I don 't think it's a bit cold for that."
"Yes, I can do that for you.
"What's up?"
Mrs. David will pick up Mrs. David from Ford Company at the Capital Airport.
The narrator doesn't want to go.
I'm supposed to do it, but the general manager called me last night. He said he couldn 't come back to Beijing as scheduled, so he asked me to attend the meeting for him.
"I see. I'll do it for you. "
no
"I am a student."
The student is studying at a school.
Day, I'm home.
No, I have no homework today.
"I'll do it later. "
Go and do it now.
Michael: I heard through the grapevine that Michael probably become the new sales manager.
The rumor came from a friend.
I am not a rumor monger.
"Can you tell me where it hurts?"
"I am so glad they called you. It feels like something is really wrong with my stomach!"
No, it doesn't hurt.
It's mostly on my right side. Right here!
"Yes, I have been feeling this way for awhile. "
I started feeling kind of sick last night after dinner, but this morning the pain got really bad!
"Have you eaten anything unusual lately?"
No, not that I remember.
"We are going to take you to an emergency room right now. "
"Good morning, sir, can I help you?"
"I'm looking for a citizen for my wife's birthday."
No, I don't like this design.
I've got to put together a sales pitch to give to our clients in the morning. You always give such amazing presentations, I was hoping you could give me some advice about how to win them over tomorrow.
The secret to a successful oral presentation is to keep things simple. People are listening and they usually don't have a long attention spans. Stick to about three or four points, give an overview of the points, then present them one by one, and then summarize at the end. Be straightforward and organized and you're sure to be remembered.
No, I don't think so.
You should consider the size and interests of your audience. In other words, who is listening, and what do they want to hear... you can put together a PPT with some graphics and animations that will catch people's attention, but be careful not to go overboard.
I can put something together, no problem. But when it comes to tomorrow, I'll just be a bundle of nerves! How can I get over my fear of speaking in public?
Yes, I am ready for the camping trip.
All set. I've got my makeup, my CDs, and my portable TV set.
"Hello! We're supposed to be getting back to nature. "
"Yeah, yeah, I'm packed. Are you?"
"I've been packed for a week. All my stuff is in this backpack."
"Let me see... two books... birdseed?"
"That's trail mix!"
"No, I don't have any hobbies."
Yes, reading is my hobby.
None of the above choices.
When I was a child in elementary school, I enjoyed reading fables and science fiction. When I became to a teenager at middle school, I was interested in detective mystery stories. Now I like reading romance stories.
No, I am not in love.
The narrator is trying to figure out why he's not getting the results he wants.
" People say only those that are in love like to read romance stories. "
Mia: Hi, I am looking for a woman named Mia.
I think I am who you are looking for. You have got to be Rubin.
"That would be me!"
"Rubin! Karen and Mike have spoken about you so often that I feel like I've met you before."
"I hope that what they had to say was mostly good!"
"They only said wonderful things about you. You did a good job of finding me."
"Finding the beautiful woman in a red dress next to the fountain wasn't all that hard "
"I guess it was a choice of me or the pigeons!"
I was hoping that we could take a walk down the street to my favorite cafe.
"This historian is famous in the field of Tang Dynasty."
So he always sits above the salt when there is a seminar about it.
Right, to be famous to be respectable in some way.
No, it's David Richton.
"Yes, I do. "
"Hello, Mr David Richton, this is Min Wang calling from network, i am calling about the reporter position you advertised on the internet."
Mr Wang is a P. M. 
" I'm a little nervous. "
The dialogue response of " Don't worry. You'll be fine. First of all, put on your seat belt. Adjust the mirrors." is:
No, I don't think so.
"Of course not. But it's a good habit to put it on every time you drive."
"Just in case, right?"
David: I am going for an interview tomorrow. It's an American company. Can you give me an idea of what the interviewer will ask?
Well, they may ask you to tell them more about your educational background and your working background.
"But they can see my resume. It's all in there."
I know, but sometimes interviewers just want to hear you say it. Then you may be asked for your viewpoint on why you feel you are qualified for the job, give them all your qualifications and how you think they will fit the position you are applying for. Questions like what sort of experience you have and what your goals? are closely related to this.
"Ok. What else?"
"They may want to know how the company will benefit and why they should hire you?"
"I see. What about the salary?"
I think the latter is more likely for a starting position, especially if you have little experience. And if they are seriously considering hiring you, they will probably want to know when you would be available to start work. And basically, that's about it.
" Ok, thanks, David. You've helped me a lot. "
Mom, what were movies like when you were a kid?
"Everything about them was different, even the theaters."
I'm really interested. Tell me about them.
"Well, where I grew up, we saw movies at a drive-in theater in our car with the whole family."
I bet you could bring your own food.
On hot days, we would take a blanket and lay in the back of dad's old pickup to watch the movie.
None of the above choices.
" Hey, daughter, let me ask you something. "
Dad : file_photo> Dad : file_photo>
Yes, I have life insurance.
No, it just seemed like another bill we ’d have to pay.
God forbid, something happens to you.
I think I should get a raise.
"No, I don't have anything to read."
"Yes, I do. "
"No, I don't have one."
Here you are.
It's rather cold this morning, wouldn't you say?
"You're right..."
Do you know the news?
"Which one?"
"Brazil won the World Cup."

"We'd better have a heart-to-heart talk with him."
But we cannot talk like elders.
We are going to spend our holiday at the beach.
I'm proficient in both written and spoken English.
"I have a degree in English. "
I studied English in junior and senior high school and in college, I took English conversation lessons. They were given by foreign tutors.
"Have you passed College English Test Band 6?"
The dialogue response of " Band 6. " is: file_other>
"Yes, I can file in English."
I'm afraid I can 't, but I 'd be glad to learn.
No, I can 't.
I often talk to foreigners at English corner held twice a week at my college. They say my English is pretty good.
"Excellent. How is your English ability in reading and writing?"
" I have been attending an evening course in English writing for 2 years and I often read novels, magazines and newspapers in English. "
The team won.
The dialogue response of "The Spur." is: file_other>
"What was the score?"
Yes, we can have dinner together this weekend.
"Ok, you name the day."
The second of March is a good day.
"What day is that?"
It's Friday.
The narrator is going to eat a sandwich.
I think I'm going to eat a piece of fruit.
None of the above choices.
I really like apples and grapes.
None of the above choices.
" I love green apples. "
I don't like green apples.
The narrator is arguing with someone.
" Green apples are too sour for me. "
No, I like red apples better.
"Yeah, I love red apples "
Mr. Wang : Yes, I feel like going boating with me.
I haven't gone boating for a while now, and what time?
"Yes, I'm free tomorrow afternoon."
"Where shall I meet you?"
At the gate of the park.
" I look forward to meeting you. "
"See you then. "
"The auction is a blast! And I haven't even told you the best part yet!"
I don't care what you say. Whatever you say won't change my mind. I'm not buying anything!
"That stamp you've been looking for is for sale."
The 1879 Large Dragon is worth a lot of money.
Jim : Hello, Jim. What was the film like?
It was a complete waste of time.
"What was it about?"
It was about a married couple. They had to live with the wife's mother, because they didn't have enough money to buy a house of their own.
A lot of young people have to do that.
The husband had to work overtime three times a week, so he was always tired.
" It sounds like the story of my life. "
It does, doesn't it? But this man was always over-tired, and he couldn't sleep. So he used to take two sleeping pill every night.
"I take sleeping pills sometimes. "
Yes, but not two every night. Anyway, the strain was too much for him. He had nervous breakdown and had to go to hospital.
"It sounds a very depressing film. "
His wife was able to find a good job as an interpreter because she could speak French and German fluently. After a few months'work, she had a better job than her husband.
"I've been looking forward to the new semester. "
" I hope we can make great progress in this new semester. "
"Hope so..."
"I hear we 'll have a new English teacher this semester."
" Really? I hope we will do much better under her guidance. "
Mark: Hi, Mark.
" Hi, Bill. I 'd like to take the apartment I looked at yesterday. "
All right.
So, what do we do now?
"This is the lease. You should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant. The lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords."
" Okay. ( Reads the lease ) So, according to the lease, I 'll deposit one month's rent as a security deposit, and I have to pay the first month's rent in advance. I understand that I 'll get the security deposit back when I move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs."
Yes, if you do not damage the apartment you will get your security deposit back when you move out.
"Yes, I can pay you by check "
"Sure. A check will be fine."
There is a laundry room in the basement.
"Yes, I do. "
" I think we should do the floors before we work on the curtains and walls. "
The dialogue response of " Why? it doesn't make sense. If we do the floors first, and then paint the walls, we will get paint all over our new floor. "
I will just cover everything with drop cloth. I won't get anything on the floor.
No, I am not sure.
Yes, I'm sure I've done a lot of house painting in my life. And my mother was very picky. If I got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture, she would get furious. So I learned to be very careful.
No, we can do it ourselves.
No, we can remove the carpet ourselves. Carpet is held down with carpet nails.
Then, after we remove the carpet, we need to redo all the wood floors.
The dialogue response of "Yes. But we should hire someone for that. That will probably be expensive. And it has to be done right." is a lie.
" And then, after the floors are done, we can start to move our furniture in."
"Yes, we will drive to the seaside "
Yes, it will take about four hours. We can leave about noon and get there by supper time.
"Let me help pay for gas. "
" All right. There will be three of us going so we will each pay a third."
"What other expenses will we have?"
Morgan : Hi Morgan, can I ask you a question?
The narrator is describing a situation.
Many Chinese people take their leftover food home from a restaurant.
In most cities in China, doggie bags are quite uncommon.
The food is thrown away.
It usually goes to the dump.
People order fewer dishes so that they don't have to throw so much away at the end of the meal.
" ordering a lot of food at restaurants is just a tradition in China. You know, in the past, people could not afford to eat out like they do today."
"I guess that makes sense. I just think it would make more sense to take the leftovers home."
"Well, if you want, you can take the leftovers home."
No, that's OK. You know what they say when in Rome.
"I was impressed that you tried the pig's feet. I heard that many foreigners don't like to eat them. "
Many people in my generation don't eat pig's feet, but my parents grew up eating them, so I think they are OK.
The dialogue response of " did you like them? You could take the last one home with you." is:
None of the above choices.
" I'm worried about the children. After all this is the first time they have been out without us. "
"Don 't worry. They are grown-ups."
"Excuse me, is there any room available?"
"Yes, when do you want it?"
No, there is no closed circuit TV.
"Yes, sir. "
The narrator is talking about laundry.
I am feeling good.
My nose keeps running. And my forehead is burning.
"You said you never went to hospital. "
" I will get better soon. "
The good thing is you don't need to go to school.
"Yeah, I love that, no class, no homework and no exams."
"And your Mom and Dad will buy you anything you ask for."
"I just got the Ultraman costume. My Dad bought it."
Danny: file_photo> Danny: file_photo> Danny: file_photo>
"I got numerous shots for that. You have no idea what I've been through with the needles."
Her sister said she fainted three times during the injection.
May told you?
"No matter what, you are still my hero, Daniel."
Tom: Promise me to keep this a secret, will you?
OK, I promise. You promise you will be well soon?
"What subject do you like best?"
English is my favorite.
No wonder your English is so good.
" Yes, I want to go to the beach tonight. "
We are going to the beach.
" I wanted to go to Malibu beach."
" I like Santa Monica "
The water there looks so dirty.
" I just like the pier they have at Santa Monica. "
" I like the pier too, because it is beautiful at night. "
Malibu beach is nice.
It's a lot nicer, and I really like it better.
So you want to go to Malibu?
"If that's okay with you. "
The marketing meeting went well.
It was awful. I think I put forward some great ideas, but none of them were accepted.
" I'm surprised to hear that. I thought you had some very good suggestions. "
So did I. I ran the ideas by a few people before the meeting and their ideas seemed to have the supports of some people.
The meeting went well.
The dialogue response of "one or two people didn 't take to my ideas very well. That was to be expected. The worst thing was that the people who said the idea was good before the meeting didn 't support me during the meeting. "
I wonder why not. We could always revise the suggestions, to take into account any objections.
" That's good advice, but I'm not confident that even revised proposals will be accepted. "
May I make a suggestion?
I'm open to any reasonable suggestions.
Is there a chance you could contact the client confidentially and see what they think? If they like your ideas, perhaps they could put them forward as their own proposals.
I'm not sure that's a good idea.
I'm so tired! I don't know how I'm going to make it through this lecture.
The professor is a bit boring today. You need something to perk yourself up. How about a coffee?
I don't really like coffee, to be honest. It's too bitter for me.
I need something to wake me up. How about a soda?
" Most some drinks have too much sugar in them. "
The diet sodas do not have any caffeic in them, which one would you like?
No, it does not contain caffeine.
The dialogue response of " unfortunately, it doesn't, how about some diet coke?"
Coke
"Maybe you should try a cappuccino or a latte ; they taste much better than plain brewed coffee."
No, they are not good.
It's just a shot of espresso beans mixed with steam milk and some chocolate syrup.
"That's perfect! Would you like one, too? My treat. "
"Welcome to Little Italy! We're the most Italian family here!"
So I've heard. That's why I'm having such a great time.
" If I hadn't married an Italian man, I probably wouldn't be pregnant so often and maybe I could raise pigs instead of bambinos!"
" Huh? Um... well, it's nice to see that some people still have big families."
Thomas: Hello, Mr Johnson.
"I do a lot of traveling..."
"I'm coming for the job you've advertised in yesterday's newspaper."
OK. What's your working experience?
"I have worked for IBM for three years. "
"My experiences benefit our company. "
" I know the marketing from top to bottom and I can develop a new market for you. "
"I am aware of the aspects of this position and do I feel I am qualified?"
Yes, I understand my qualification and your needs by researching your company.
None of the above choices.
"If possible, I'd like to be positioned in the International Trade Department."
"Then, what is your starting salary?"
No, I am not Elvin.
Elvin Dixon : Who are you?
Mary: I really admire the software you've designed.
" Easy stuff. But thanks. And the admiration is mutual."
"What is it?"
"You're selling invoking subscriptions like nobody's business. And we don't even have a working demo yet."
I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend.
The weather is going to be fine.
The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend.
Yes, it will be perfect weather for the beach.
"It sounds like it will be. "
" I really hope it doesn't get cold. "
" That would ruin things, I want to go so badly. "
The weather in California is unpredictable, so you never know.
The weather is constantly changing.
" It would be nice if the weather would never change. "
" That would be great, then we could plan things sooner. "
"You say he was around average height?"
"Yeah, that's right, around five nine five ten."
The narrator says he's a big guy.
"I'm not sure. Medium, I suppose. Maybe a little on the heavy side."
He has karks on his face.
No, I don't think so.
Glasses?
No, I am not.
His hair is unkempt.
"Black or dark brown."
Straight
" Straight, I think, and about average length. "
Boy, this surely doesn't help us much.It could be anybody.How about his cloth? What was he wearing.
"Well, he had a Jacked or a Plage shirt. You know the kind of number jack wear."
"where are we getting some pants?"
Dark, maybe dark blue maybe black. I'm not sure.
"What kind of shoes are you wearing?"
"Boots": file_gif>
Cow while Boots.
No, hiking boots. Brown ones.

"1446 Pine. That's in San Francisco, isn't it?"
"What do you think is the role of the teacher in the classroom?"
" Teachers are just directors who give scope to the students'initiative and creativeness instead of taking their rights away from speaking. "
The narrator put it into practice.
"What do you say we stop in at that Burger King over there and grab a bite?"
The dialogue response of "Forget it! If you think I 'd ever set foot that inferior restaurant again, you gotta be nuts. Last time I ate that food, almost vomited. The service in there is terrible. It was the first time I ever stiffed a waiter" is:
The narrator is looking for someone.

It's on me.

"I'm looking for some earrings for my wife as a wedding anniversary gift."
"You've come to the right store. We've got a beautiful and wide selection of earrings for you to choose from."
I saw a pair of earrings outside your window. Can you show them to me?
No, I mean the pearl earrings.
Exactly. How much do you want for them?
"They're only three thousand yuan."
This setting is made of wood.
"Well, it's specially made of a platinum alloy, sir, and the lustre will never fade away."
I'll take them. Please wrap them up tor me and give me the receipt.
"Thank you for coming to see me off."
Not at all.
" If I have time, I will come again. "

A movie is on right now.
No, I don't want to read it.
"Good afternoon, Ladies. May I help you?"
"Yes, sir, we can have two double rooms.
"Have you made a reservation ladies?"
I'm afraid not.
I'm sorry ladies. We have only two double room available, but they are on different floors. Would you mind that?
"We prefer they are on the same floor because we have a problem check late that night."
"May I suggest family sweet? You all just have a consolation."
"What's it like? "
It's a big room with a king-size double bed and two single beds. You've also an roller-wheels.
"That's great, how much is it?"

No, I don't feel like dancing.
None of the above choices.
"Alright. At least that's better than sitting in a bar with your alcoholic friends."
They aren't alcoholic.
No, maybe they're not. But they're close.
"So where should we go?"
"Let's go to the Latin Club. I think they will have a Brazilian band there this weekend. Maybe it's Friday night."
I don't know those dance steps. I'd rather go to the New Bar.
The narrator does not want to dance to techno music on Friday night.
It's not all techno music. It's not a special techno night.
No. But they play techno all the time. It drives me crazy after forty minutes.And anyhow, if we go to the Latin Club you could actually learn some Latin dance steps. At the New Bar you'll just shake yourself around for an hour.And then you'll get sick of stand you'll want to go get drunk somewhere where the drinks are cheaper. I know you.
"Latin Club"
"Oh. You mean Jerry's, over on the east side. That wasn't my idea going there."
No, it was that friend of yours, Melissa. Her and all her lousy country music CDs. Yecch!
No, it is the Latin Club.
"Yes. You have to teach me the samba, and the tango and whatever else they do."
The narrator will have to learn Spanish too, won't they?
"I'm going to New York for the first time, but I don't have a tour guide. Can you give me any suggestions?"

It's interesting what it does.

" Hi, Mr. Brown, we have visited the factories and I'm very satisfied with your factories production conditions. "
Yes, they are our main export bases of tools with the advantage of having good production experience and long historical record.
"That's very good. But I have little knowledge about the packing of your pliers. I just want to know the details about that."
" Ok, I'll show you how the packing is like. We have a showroom on the ground floor. Let's go downstairs and have a look."
"Sure..."
Normally, we have three types of packing.
" Oh, the packing looks very nice. "
The skin packing is the most advanced packing in the world market. It catches the eyes and can help push sales.
Good, what about the export packing?
"Well, they are packed in two dozens each, 100 boxes to a wooden case."
The wooden case is not strong enough for transportation.
" So far, no customers have complained about our outer packing."
No, I don't accept neutral packing.
Yes, we can pack the goods according to your instructions.

It's so great to be here! I'm so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home!
We're glad that you're here. Would you like a tour of the house?
" That 'd be great, but could I have a cup of tea first?"
I 'll just go put the kettle on. Why don 't you have a seat on the sofa and I 'll go take care of things in the kitchen.
"That would be lovely, thanks."

"My parents gave them to us as a house warming gift."
The dialogue response of " oh dear. Well, I suppose they will do for now. do you ever dust in here? It seems a bit dusty in here. "
Her daughter usually does the dusting, and I do the vacuuming.

"Well, now you're really going to freak out when I tell you who aced it... what's-her-face... the one who always kisses up to the teacher."
Jennifer Davies? Give me a break! I can't stand her.
She's the teacher's pet, that's why. Besides, he's so laid back he lets her get away with it. She just really rubs me the wrong way. And you know what? I think she's got the hots for him, too.
"Get out of here!"
" I'm dead serious. Yesterday, before class starts, she walks up to Mr - Edward's desk and goes, ‘ Good morning, Jim. '"
"I've moved. "
A car.
An old one.
It's old, but what makes it?
The narrator is going into the car business.
My cousin is going to take a job overseas and he can't take his car with him, so he's going to sell it - cheap. It's practically new.
I have been thinking about getting a newer car. I can't afford a brand new one.

" I was just concerned about Sam. He hasn't been himself lately."
He took the civil service exam and failed.
" That sucks. He must feel depressed. "
He has been sitting in his room everyday for the last 4 days.
" Why don't we take him out? We can try to take his mind off of it. In the least show him that we're there for him."
I already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else.
"Ok. I'll call you back after I'm done."
"I'm checking out in about half an hour."
"Whenever you're ready to check out, I'll be ready sir."
"Great! As you know however, the day in New York has hardly begun."
"You're right. It's only 9"
"Therefore, I think I'll explore New York some more. But I need to store my bags."
"Sir, our storage facility is merely $ 5 an hour. You also need to leave a deposit."
My luggage isn't enough of a deposit.
"Unfortunately, it isn't. VISA or MasterCard will suffice, though."
"Well, then. Let me put on my thinking cap for a moment. "
Madam : Yes, I would like to order now.
Yes, please. I'd like the steak and mushrooms.

" I went a global warming rally in London. It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment. "
"I don't think we can do anything to reverse the damage that's been done already."
It might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves, but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening.
Like what?
Well, we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start.
"What else can we do to protect the environment?"
If you do have to drive, you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol. Also, your home should use sources of renewable energy.
No, it does not.
Yes, you should take your glass, paper, plastic, cardboard and tin cans to a recycling center.
"What do you think is the biggest worry for our future?"
"I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone "
"I had no idea you were such an environmentalist before!"
"I'd like to apply for a credit card. Can you help me with my application?"
"I'd be glad to.
"I'm afraid that I don't have a credit history. I just came to this country."
No, I do not have an account with this bank.
"I'm afraid not. "
"In that case I highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also. That would help with your credit card application."
"What is the interest rate on your card?"
The annual charge rate is 9.5 %.
"That's very expensive!"
The credit card is a revolving account. You only pay interest on what you owe.
The bank bills its customers for credit card charges.

No, it does not.
no
Gas and water are included.

The dialogue response of "Please follow my instructions. Use a wet towel to cover your mouth and nose. Walk quietly to the nearest emergency exit. Now go get the wet towel."
" OK. "
"Come with me."

"Don't take your personal belongings. We need to get out of the building now!"
Gosh! I can see the flames!
The Board of Directors, the CEO, and the stockholders are the same group of people to me.
No, there's a definite difference. You know, the stockholders are the people who own the company... they're the financial control system. Then there's the CEO—the chief executive officer. He's the hot shot, the main guy who is the boss. If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization, everyone knows that the power will go to their head. It's too dangerous. That's the reason for a Board of Directors. The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry. They could be related to the organization, but more commonly they are independent and non-biased.

The narrator spends the weekend at home.
"We've a country house. "
" That's nice. "

It is a pretty big mechanical company. I am assigned to work in the assembly shop.
" How long will you work a day?"
My working hours aren 't fixed, sometimes I do the day shift, sometimes the night shift. In all, about 8 hours.
"That's rather hard."
"But it matches my major."

My wage depends on production results.
None of the above choices.
The company provides labor insurance for all employees, as well as a fine retirement policy.
Yes, there is a union.
"There is the company union, but it really shares the same aims as the management."
So you must consider dearly before you go to work.
Mr Janus: Hello Mr Janus. What can we do for you today?
Miao Ping: It's that time again ; I want to convert my salary. You know, it's so annoying. I wish my company could just pay me in RIB.
"Haha! I actually think that many locals would disagree with you ; they are all dying to be paid in US dollars."
"Yes, I guess you are right. So, do you need my passport?"
"Thanks, Mr Janus. Of course I trust you, but regulations are regulations."
"Here you go. "
" That's really a let-down. "
"Yeah. He really does let me down."

Let me have a try.
"Wow, it has a balcony."
"Yeah. Complete with nice of you. "
"How many windows are there in the apartment?"
There are 2 in the bedroom, and 1 each in the living room and kitchen.
It's just what I want, I think I am ready to sign.
"I call the landlord right now. "
"Yes, I have a few questions. "
Yes, the renting includes utilities.
It includes everything except cable TV, and telephone.
"How much is the cable?"
It usually comes out about $ 40 a month.
no
No, I am afraid the apartment isn 't permitted.
No, I don't like pets.
"I am having some plumbing problems and need them fixed. "
The plumbing is leaking.
The toilet flushes really slowly.
No, there are no problems with the plumbing in the kitchen
Both the kitchen and the bathroom plumbing are messed up.
"I have had these problems for a long time. "
"It has been going on for a while, but just started to get worse this morning."
" I will be home this afternoon. "
Yes, I will be home this afternoon.
None of the above choices.
"People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country."
"Yeah, several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years. It seems they will never end."
The dialogue responds to "How do you think they could be ended?"
" I don't think that there is any easy way. "
"I think one better way to stop it is to cut off their financial support."
"Good evening, I'm so happy you could come."
"Thank you for inviting me. "
"What would you like to drink?"
The tea smells good.
Longing Tea is a special green tea from Zhejiang province.
It has a pleasant smell.

None of the above choices.
In hot or warm days, tea helps to dispel the heat and brings on an instant cool with a feeling of relaxation. Moreover, the tea leaves contain a number of chemicals which are good for people's health.
No, the stronger the better.
No. Constant drinking of over-strong tea would do harm to people's health. So don't make your tea too strong.
The proper time for tea is in the afternoon.
It's fine for most time of the day. But don't have tea before bedtime.
The narrator is trying to figure out why he's not getting the results he wants.
Maris is a part-timer.
" Part-timer? Is that a new buzzword?"
It's pretty popular among my classmates these days.
I have a part-time job as a bartender.
It must be amazing to work at a bar.
No, I'm not there for fun. I have to remain professional and if I get distracted, the manager would be pretty upset.
The narrator learned a lot from the job.
I got to know more about the real world.
"Yes, I got working experience, right?"
I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life.
It must be very demanding.
After working for a few weeks, it's easy to figure out.
"Really? It sounds interesting. "
Maybe you can come to the bar one day and I 'll show you around.
I'm going for a walk, Yi-jun. I need some time to myself.
No, I don't want to go to the visiting hours.
"I just can't right now. Everyone will be talking about Taylor and..."
" Maybe that's what we both need. "
I need to come to grips with his death first. And I also need to prepare a eulogy in case I'm asked to speak tomorrow.
"I will take it. How much?"
"how much is 60 dollars?"
" I am sure you can do better than that. "
"Sorry, sir. It's the sale price."
$ 70 with a scarf.
"Hello, Ellen. "
Helen: Have you heard the news? There's been a horrible accident.
"Oh no! What happened?"
Henry had an accident on his way home from work.
He was hurt.
Yes, he was taken to the hospital in an ambulance.
"It was an accident. "
His car was hit by an express train. It happened at the crossing just behind his house.
"How horrible!"
He's having an operation in the hospital now. Poor Hilda! You can imagine how unhappy she is.
" I hope he 'll be all right. "
I am going to work tomorrow.
I'm going to work.
"What time will you be home?"
Richard: Do you have the number for that Chinese restaurant on the corner?
I've got it in my office. Here it is. 553-2213.
553-2213.
Mr Moon, how good to see you again.
Miao Ping: Hello, Miao Ping, I'm here to chat with you about Corporate Agreement Savings. What can you tell me?
The dialogue response of "Well, Corporate Agreement Savings will be based on the Agreement Deposit Contract signed by the customer and the bank together. "
"What if I exceed?"
If it goes beyond the basic deposit, the agreement will be settled at the rate agreement savings which has been determined by the People's Bank of China on the day you wish to settle or withdraw.
When shooting a gun, accuracy is very important.
"What's eating you?"
Dick keeps getting on my nerves.
He used to be as meek as a lamb.
Yes, he used to be. But now he's drifting off track.
Todd: Hi Linda, this is Todd.
Todd: Good to hear from you!
"I just wanted to tell you what a great time I had with you at the movies last week. "
"Me too, Todd! Thanks for suggesting that great movie. "
I also enjoyed it and was wondering if you would like to go for a hike in the mountains with me on Saturday.
I would love to join you on a hike. Could I maybe bring a picnic lunch for us to eat on the trail?
Linda: Sure Linda, that's a great suggestion.
"Fine then, what time are we going to leave?"
I was thinking maybe 9 o'clock or so, so that we could get started before the heat gets too bad.
The police pulled him over because he was speeding.
No, I did not see it.
I ran a red light.
"Yes, I did. "
"I apologize, but I didn't realize that I did. "

None of the above choices.
"I don't know what to tell you. "
"I'm going to have to write you a ticket."
"I understand. "
"How much do I have to pay?"
" 70, madam. "
The narrator will put the bread in a separate bag.
"Don't I know you?"
"I'm not sure. You look familiar."
Mr.Stevenson, right?
It's a new car, but it's totaled.
"Well, your insurance covers sufficient money to replace it. So you don 't need to worry."
I don 't think I could afford that kind of car again. I think I 'll have to choose something that is not as hard to replace.
" Since you are not the one who caused the accident, your insurance cost should be the same."
no
No, I would not want full coverage.
Sir, here is your curried beef.
"Well. I am afraid you have made a mistake. It's not the dish I ordered."
"Let me see, I am sorry. It's for table 11."
Hi, what're you reading?
No, I haven't read it.
Not yet, but I saw the movie. Could I borrow it when you finish reading?
"Yes, I brought the receipt with me.
No, I don't. I left it home.
"Sorry, but we can't do anything without the receipt. Come back with it."
I didn't know. I'll go to get it. How late will you be open?
Lucy: Hi, Lucy, you are very popular with people around you. What are your tricks?
I think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues.
People may think you are telling them how to do their work, if they take it personally, they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work.
It is not sensible at all to argue with the others or correct someone in front of other people. To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off.
"You are quite right. Thank you for sharing your experience with me. I learned a lot."
Jill : I like it a lot.
I like it. But how did you know about my new job?
I just heard through the grapevine something about you landing a job with some travel agency down town. You can still fill me in on tile details.
"Well, two weeks ago I got a tip about a possible job opening at Ace Travel Agency over on Franklin Avenue."
" Sure, I think I know the place. "
I made a beeline over to their office, had an interview with the manager, and was told to start work the next day.
Jill : Hi, I'm jill. I work as a nurse in a hospital.
"Right now I'm basically just a secretary, but if I'm given the chance, I want to become a travel agent there."
"Don't tell me your're already bucking for a promotion. "
No, of course not. I ’ve got a lot to learn yet. In the meantime, I just want to be a good secretary and not step on anyone ’s toes.
"Morning. May I help you?"
Yes, I'd like to open an account that enables me to draw money easily.
"Well, in that case, I think a checking account may be more convenient for you. However, there's a service charge."
"How much is the service charge?"
One percent.
300 dollars is enough for a minimal deposit.
"More than enough. Please fill in this form."
"Anything else?"
"Excuse me, I want to know the price of your CPU "
Glad to tell you, the price of CPU is 300 dollars.
It's rather too high. If you can make it cheaper, we will be able to place large orders continuously.
If you order a large amount, we can give you a discount.
"Well, can you explain it to me?"
The price of CPU is 260 dollars above 1,000 Units.
"Yes, I can reduce more.
"I'm sorry, but to be frank, considering exploiting the market in your country, we have already supplied you at very low preferential price."
In that case, we have to stop ordering if a reduction can't be made. Please reconsider.
"It is so hard to deal with. "
" If you can give us a more reduction, We'd be able to give you an order on the spot."
"What's the matter with you? You look so upset and tired."
My father failed in business.
" Oh, that's really tough. "
"Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced."
I can understand. By the way, is there anyway I can help?
No, not now. I have found a part-time job. So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties.
" Oh, that's so great, bless you! if you need me, I'll always be there."
OK! Let's get down to business now.
"Say it. "
" As you know, we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion, so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product, L-series."
" That's right, and in my opinion, to push the sale of the new products is not an easy task."
" I know that. I need to discuss this with Arden. And in his opinion, we should widen the scope of our ads, so newspaper and Internet should be adopted in this campaign."
"Could you put it in detail?"
Well, we plan to contact www. on-line advertising. com.cn and Shanghai Morning Newspaper to discuss the advertisement schedule.
" I think the idea is very good. In the promotion campaign, two or more media are used together, so as to draw customers'attention and keep hold their attention to larger extent."
"What kind of media do you recommend?"
" I think TV is also an effective media, as long as our company is willing to spend more money on it."
Arden mentioned the paper and the on-sales. And I can talk about TV with him later, because TV promotion gets more and more popular among consumers.
" I feel so uncomfortable. "
No, I am fine.
No, the teacher is dragging the chalk over the blackboard.
Mary: Hi John, this is Mary, your tenant up in Lincoln Park.
Mary: Hi, Mary. What can I do for you?
"I was wondering when trash collection day was. "
It's on Tuesdays and Fridays.
" Great...
"You could save a couple of dollars by taking it to the dump yourself, though."
"Oh, o. k. Where ’s that?"
It's at the corner of that street.
"Thanks. Who do I call for trash collection?"
The dialogue response of "Just leave the stuff by the curb. The company 'll send a guy out next month to give you the bill." is:
All right, thanks a lot.
"Good morning, Mr. Zhang, this is Jimmy calling from Polaroid Company."
Jimmy: Hi, good morning.
"I regret to tell you that the position of Sales Manager has gone to another person."
"I see. "
"We really believe that you are a highly qualified person, but the other candidate has several years of related experiences. "
"Maybe that is true, but I am a fast learner and I am willing to work overtime, and I do not mind a lot of business travel."
" We surely believe you. "
"Can't you give me another chance and reconsider your decision?"
" I am afraid we are sticking to our choice. "
Possibly you are now. But in case you will change your mind, please let me know.
no
Yes, I am studying in Eastern Asian language department.
"What are you majoring in?"
I major in Japanese.
"What do you think of the literature course. "
" See? That wasn't so bad. "
"Easy for you to say. My bottom still stings."
It might be sore for a while. You'll be OK. Now let's go home and rest.
"Yes, we can go to McDonald's first. "
No, sweetie. I'll make you some tomato soup and rice.
No, thanks.
"And vegetables with porridge."
Blah... What's that?
" This is going to surprise you, but I'm happy. I think you're making the right move."
"What do you do for a living?"
"Look, maybe I shouldn't tell you this, but I'm going over to WebTracker too."
"No way! Then we'll still be together!"
"Actually, I'm already working for WebTracker. Vince never wanted to give me what I was worth, so I figured, what the heck."
"No kidding! I can't believe this. You devil!"
" Yes, I'm all set now."
" Oh, thank you so much. "
"Really, it was nothing. "
" I really appreciate it. "
"I was happy to help. "
"It was so kind of you.
Don 't mention it.
"I want to rent this apartment. "
" I'm glad to hear that. "
"How much are you asking?"
"You will have to pay $ 1050 every month. "
" I can 't afford that. "
"What can I afford?"
" I was thinking $ 800 a month. "
"I 'll need you to pay more than that. "
"How much more?"
$ 900 every month sounds good to me.
" I can live with that. "
Yes, we are allowed to wear casual clothes in the office.
"Sure, company rules are not very strict at this point."
"Thank you for telling me that. "
But remind you, there are some forbidden activities.
"What are they? I 'll be careful."
Don 't use office phones for personal matters.
" I got it. "
"Never ever come to work drunk, also smoking in the office is not allowed."
"Thank you for letting me borrow your portable CD player. "
"I think it's a good company.
"You are the leading company in the computer industry."
I think it's a good idea.
First, your overwhelming share in the world market. Second, your superiority in sales and profits in addition to the amount of capital and the number of employees. Third, the diversity in your production line is second to none.
business
Shirley: Hey, wanna join me for lunch... my treat!
"Wow! Sure!"
"I must confess I have an ulterior motive for asking you to lunch. "
"Oh... as long as you're buying!"
I really want to pick your brain about something I've been thinking a lot about.
"I'd love to help if I can. "
"Well, as you know, I have a Bachelor's degree in English literature and that's served me well so far, but I've always wanted to do some post-graduate work... maybe even get a Doctorate!"
"Wow! Just the idea of going back to school fills my head with pain."
"Yes, it has..."
"Yeah, I'd have to say it has. But I'm still paying for it, you know."
I know education is expensive, but it's my lifelong dream. Call me crazy, but I've always wanted to have that PhD at the end of my name.
No, I can 't afford that.
"I certainly can't afford it, but I'm sure I could find some good student loans."
"I think you need to separate the dream of having a PhD from the reality of years of more schooling. It's not as romantic as you might think."
I love language but I don't think there are a lot of well-paying jobs out there for experts on Shakespeare.
Dad, I'm scared.
Take it easy, honey. It's just raining cats and dogs.
But, dad, it's stormy outside.
"Honey, it's just windy and raining outside."
The boss had an informal discussion with me this morning, I feel really down.
"What's up?"
"Well, actually I failed to meet a deadline last week and I forgot to answer an e-mail for a VIP customer yesterday. "
None of the above choices.
I can 't manage my time well. I can 't handle work well. I am afraid I was screw up more things.
It's our company's busiest time in a year. You need to relax a little, ok?
"It's time to leave the office for the night. Firstly I log off my computer, then I set the electronic security system."
" That's pretty advanced. "
"Now I'll quickly send a short message to my wife and take the elevator down to the basement."
"Yes, that's where I park."
Yes, the car park is under constant video surveillance, so my car is quite safe.
"where is your key?"
I have keyless entry, and the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car. Now, we can look at the navigation system to find the best route home.
"That's amazing, it even shows all the roads that are congested at the moment."
"Using GPS I can rely on this to direct me home. Now I just need to find my E-Card to automatically open the gate and we can drive out."
"Pretty soon cars will be driving themselves."
"Maybe, but in the meantime why not help me find the remote control for my garage door?"
Here it is, and here we are.
When I turn off my home alarm, the house will automatically turn on the lights and set the climate to a comfortable level.
Be careful. The floor is wet.
"What happened?"
"Yes, I have come to a decision. "
"What's the real difference, except the amounts available?"
"What is a visible certificate?"
No, they cannot be cashed before the maturity date.
No, they can be bought and sold by anyone
I could transfer it to get some money.
" Technically, yes."
"I finally lost that last five pounds I've been working on forever!"
I finally did it.
A friend suggested that I stop nibbling between meals.
Like snacking?
"You know, a little piece of chocolate here, some chips on the side, candy now and then..."
" I get what you mean. "
Instead, I sit down and have a good snack like a piece of fruit between meals.
The narrator is at the finest centre again.
I'm going to do some jogging on the treadmill. Then I think I'll do some work with the dumbbless.
Good idea. I'd suggest you do some crunches too. Thery're great for getting in shape. Make sure you do them correctly.
Ok. I will. Could you help me with the treadmill? I found it difficult to get the setting right last time.
No, this is my second visit.
Yes, it is. I'll be coming here regularly. I think I need regular exercise to get in shape and then to stay in shape.
The treadmill is excellent for helping you to build up stamina. Each time you use it, increase this distance. don't worry about your speed at first. You can increase that later.
I was told that the first time I came heer, I was told not to put too much pressure on my body at first. I need to build up slowly.
"Good morning, sir. How may I help you?"
Yes, there are rooms available at the moment.
No, we don't.
"I'd like a suite for four nights. "
"Please wait a moment while I check availability. Ah, sir. We only have a double room available now."
The narrator replies, "That's all right. How much do they cost?"
Each night costs 320 RIB, but for a four night stay, we can offer a discount of 15 %.
"How much in total?"
1088 RIB.
No, breakfast is not included.
Yes, it is. You also have free use of the leisure facilities here.
"That's fine. I'll get it."
OK. Please fill out this form with your details.
No, you do not need to pay a deposit.
Yes, you do. There is a 300 RIB deposit, which we will refund when you check out. So, in total, you need to pay 1388 RIB.
"Fine. Here you are."
A porter will take your luggage to your room and the elevator is just around the corner.
"Thank you very much. "
"It is my pleasure sir. I wish you a pleasant stay here. Goodbye!"
"How many people are there in your family?"
"how many people in your family?"
How many children do you have?
"How many people are there?"
"Yes, we live together. "
My father's parents, Mum, Dad, three unmarried aunts, two uncles, my two brothers, my three sisters and me.
But you don't live at home anymore.
"Right, but that's where my heart is. But you're right, now there are only 14 living at home."
My goodness! Your family must live in a huge house.
My family lives in rural Korea, near Pusan. The first floor of the house is a part-time private school. In the afternoon, students come for special tutoring in biology, English.
"Wow! you grew up in a school! No wonder your English is excellent!"
My aunts and uncles are all teachers.
"You are so lucky!"
"I guess so, I read hundreds of interesting English storybooks every year."
"That's what I did in America. I was reading all the time. I was never a big TV watcher. TV wastes time."
Reading for fun is why all the English students at our family school have excellent English. All the students read 800 easy storybooks during their second year of studying English.
" 800 books? I'm impressed!"
They are my parents.
My mother is a professor and my father is a manager.
No, they rarely take me out.
" Hi, come on in. Can I take your coat?"
I brought you a bottle of wine as well.
"You're the first guest to arrive. I'll just put your coat away and then I'll get you something to drink."
"Should I take my shoes off?"
"whatever you prefer."
The narrator has been living in this place for a long time.

The narrator is going to have a glass of red wine.
4 people are coming for dinner tonight.
"There's just going to be 6 of us tonight. "
The dialogue response of " oh, I thought there were going to be eight. who isn't coming?" is:
Marcia: Paul called to cancel at the last moment. Marcia: Paul was running late and Marcia wasn't feeling well.
"That's too bad. They're such good company."
Someone is at the door.
"How much does it cost for a bus pass?"
"It'll be $ 65 for a monthly pass."
"Is there anything cheaper than that?"
If you're in school, you can get a student pass.
"Well, I am how much will that cost?"
The pass is free.
"I don't have to pay for anything?"
"You'll only have to pay for the monthly sticker."
"How much is the monthly sticker?"
"It's $ 24 for each month."
"I'll take the student bus pass."
Chary is busy this evening.
I'm afraid that I've got plans tonight.
The narrator is describing what they are doing.
"I'm going to my parents'house for my father's birthday. "
He is a young man.
It's his 50th birthday.
"Well, wish him a happy birthday for me."
The narrator will go out for the evening.
" I was just thinking of going to a movie tonight. "
"Well, if you can wait until tomorrow night, I'll go with you then."
" Sorry, I've got people coming over tomorrow night. "
" Sounds like this weekend just isn't going to work out for us. "
" Maybe some other time then?"
"I'm sorry, but I've got to get going."
"Yeah, me too. It's about time I made a move."
Say hello to your friends for me.
" Likewise. See you later. "
I can 't attend the meeting in Washington. I've proposed you as the most able substitute.
"I've never been on a business trip before!"
It's easy enough. Just make sure you keep track of all your expenses. The accounting department will reimburse you for all your meals and travel expenses.
The company will pay for everything.
"Yes, but when you send in your expense report, you also have to file a report summarizing your trip, you know."
"What do you want me to do there?"
May I help you?
Yes, I can cash my traveler's check here.
"Of course, we'd be happy to cash it for you. "
"What's the cashing rate?"
"Well, it's listed on the electronic board on the left. We cash it at present traveler's check buying rate."
"Oh, I see. How much is the service charge?"
1 % of the total amount of the check.
Well, I'd like to cash these four checks for $ 100 each.
"Yes, I would like to countersign them here."
OK, there you are.
"And your passport please."
"Oh, I forgot to bring it. It is in my hotel room."
"Sorry, sir. We can't cash the checks for you without your passport."
Waiter, I'm afraid you must have calculated my bill wrong.
" There's a possibility. I 'll check it."
"Thank you. "
"Excuse me, I need your assistance."
"What's up?"
"I have no idea where my class is. "
The dialogue response of "Tell me which building it's in." is:
My class is in the C building.
"I know where the C building is. "
"Yes, I'd like to know where it is."
"Room 123"
The number 261 is a telephone number.
I actually have a class right around there.
"Can you please show me?"
Yes, it is a beautiful country.
not everyone thinks japan is beautiful, but to me its beauty is breathtaking
The swift rivers, the fertile valleys, the large cities-its scenery is beautiful.
France is not an island.
No, France isn't an island. It is located in the western part of the European continent.
France isn't very mountainous, is it?
None of the above choices.
France has a mild climate, doesn't it?
No, Japan is not good for farming.
No, rice is not grown in France, is it?
No, rice isn't grown in France.
Mary: I just want to let you know that we made an offer to you. The salary is 3,000 yuan a month, I e-mailed the offer to you as well. You can let me know within a week if you accept the offer.
"Thank you. I'll go through it and tell you. "
"We hope you get on board with us, Please let me know as soon as possible."
I've got a temperature and my stomach hurts.
I have been feeling this way for a long time.
"It all started the day before yesterday."
"You seem to have picked up some kind of infection. "
"What should I do?"
"I've just taken a spanner set from the stores."
"That's fine. Don't forget to update the inventory."
"Sorry, what do you mean?"
I'd like to make a reservation to Los Angeles for next Monday.
"Just a second and I'll check the schedule."
"I'll need an economy ticket with an open return."
American Airlines has a flight leaving at 9:25 a. m.
I guess that's OK. What time should I check in?
"You're making my blood boil. "
Madam : Calm down.
I'm about to explode! You've made a mess of this matter.
"I am very sorry to hear that you've been having so many problems. "
"What can you do to help me?"
" I understand why you're angry, Mrs. Wilson, and believe me, we are doing everything in our power to work this out."
" Well, obviously, what you're doing is not good enough!"
"Hey man, you hit my car."
"I really didn't mean to. "
It doesn't matter, because you damaged my car.
" It looks okay to me. "
"Look what you did to my rear bumper."
None of the above choices.
My bumper is smashed in.
"I didn't do that. "
"Your front bumper is just as damaged. "
"If you'd just give me your number and insurance, then I'll handle it."
I'd better get a call from you.
Sis, why did you ask me to come to this bargain market? It's so crowded, and you can't find anything that you really want.
" You just don't get it. Looking for bargains can be really interesting."
No, I am not serious.
Bargaining is a game, or even a battle. You feel like a winner when you get a good price.
Come on. You know, you can never really win. The salesperson never loses. They make their living out of it.
"That's true. But I just love it. Come here!"
This silk carpet is really beautiful, and how delicate it is!
The dialogue response of " You do have great taste, that's the most expensive stuff here." is:
"Really? Oh, this one. I like the cloisonn vase."
I like them.
Come on. They look so cheap. Something else, please.
Benjamin would like it.
" Don't underestimate his taste. I don't think he'd like it."
He loves the vase I bought here last week.
"Yeah. Well, anyway, it's up to you. But I can tell that you come here often. "
No, I study English at the university here.
It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing.
Yes, I am Chinese.
Yes, I am from Taiwan. I came here to study political science.
" I like it so far. But my English still needs work. "
I want to study Mandarin and international relations.
regular characters
They teach regular characters.
I'm from Taiwan, so I know regular characters better than simplified.
"Yes, I need to work on my English.
I think my papers aren't good enough.
I am very serious about learning Chinese. But for me the hard part now is pronunciation. You have the four tones in Chinese. It is very hard. Maybe, if you have time, maybe we could do a language exchange.
"You mean you and I?"
I mean, if you come to this cafe often, maybe we could meet here and practice Chinese and English.
It sounds like a good idea. How often would you like to do it?
"Let's see... My schedule right now is quite busy. But I think I could spend 90 minutes a week in language exchange."
How would we spend the 90 minutes?
First, we could spend 45 minutes working on your English writing.If you want, I could help you edit your papers.Or we could do English conversation. Whatever you want.And then the next 45 minutes you would help me with my Chinese.
"Yes, I would like to help you with writing. "
No, the important thing is spoken Chinese. I need practice. So you could tutor me in speaking.We could use my textbook, and you could ask me questions. Then you could correct my mistakes.
I think it sounds like a good system. But when is it convenient to meet?
Monday at this time would be the best.
"Me too. In fact, I'm free until 1"
"So if you want to meet at 10?"
It sounds good. I will bring the papers I'm working on.
"And I will bring my textbook and a tape recorder. I would like to record some things so I can practice on my own."
Let me give you my phone number.
"Yes, I called you. "
Thank you for returning my call.
"What was your call about?"
"I wanted to have a talk with you about your son. "
"What did he do?"
He was messing around last week in class.
He did not say what he did.
" Even though I asked him not to, he kept speaking out in class. "
"I don't know what his problem is. "
I need you to talk to him, if you don't mind.
"That won't happen again, I'm sorry."
May I help you?
Yes, I am going to have a summer vacation. Would you recommend some scenic spots to see?
"Which place are you most interested in?"
"Maybe Europe."
"Well, I strongly suggest you going to London. It's really charming."
May I see your passport, please?
"Certainly. Here it is."
"Yes, I am here on business. "
"That's right, a German company has invited me for business talks."
The narrator will be staying for a few days.
"Just two weeks. "
Two pieces of baggage
"Only one. In this case, I have a camera."
Yes, I intend to take it out on my departure.
"Yes, I do. "
According to the regulations, the camera you've brought along for personal use can be passed for the time being duty free, but you will have to take it out with you when you leave the country.
I will.
"Well. Have a pleasant stay in Germany."
full time
"To start with I would like something part time with the hope that it can develop into something full time."
"Yes, I am interested in being with a company for the long term. "
Yes, that's right. I like this city very much and would like to make my home here.
No, I did not bring a resume and references.
"Yes, I did. I have them here."
Keep them until you ready to give me the application and you can turn them all in at once.
No, I can't recommend any cosmetics.
"I think Pond's is the best."
"And they're very dear, too. "
"They're on special offer today."
" All right. But these are black and I don 't like black shoes. They're dull."
black is a better color than pink.
None of the above choices.
Because... oh, all right. You win. Let ’s pay for them and go.
"Where did you get your mobile? It's really cute."
The narrator got it in Singapore.
Gee, it's really light!
No, it's not.
I've got an old Ericsson. Here. Take a look.
"Wow, that's really old. "
Yes, I like collecting antiques.
The narrator doesn't want to buy a new one.
I like this one, and I don't have any need for all the bells and whistles you get on the new ones.
The narrator is narrating a story.
No, I rarely use it.
Sometimes, but I guess not very often. It's more for fun. Sometimes when I'm on a trip, for example, I can take a picture and send it to my kids or I can send a picture of a sample back to my office and get it costed up immediately.
"Well, that's nice I guess. How many kids do you have?"
"How many orders do we still need to pack, Gale?"
"We still have to do about ten more."
"Well. I am really tired from packing all of the stuff all day. And it's about time to clock out."
I know. Maybe we can finish it tomorrow.
The orders are not urgent. We could do it first thing tomorrow morning.
" All right. Let's call it quits and go home."
Parker: Hello, Parker. How's everything?
" Can 't complain. And you?"
Business is booming. I understand you want to meet up with me next week. How's your schedule looking?
Let me see. I can come out and see you first thing Wednesday.
"What's for dinner?"
The dialogue response of "Leftovers." is:
Leftovers of what and from when?
"From last night! I took the left over turkey, mixed it with some diced peppers and onions, added a little bit of mayonnaise and made some sandwiches!"
"Yes, it is dangerous. I mean bacteria and germs reproducing on food that was left out or re-heated.
"Well, I didn't leave the turkey out at room temperature for more than an hour and I refrigerated it soon after we finished eating. Also, when reheating, I put it in the oven for fifteen minutes at one hundred degrees Celsius."
" I am just afraid of getting food poisoning. "
No, I do not have any hobbies.
Yes, I like gardening.
The narrator has a garden.
"Yes, follow me. Here it is."
"Your garden is really lovely. "
"Thank you. "
Yes, I take care of them everyday.
"Yes, I do. "
"No, I don't feel dull at all.
No, my eye doctor prescribed me glasses.
No, I ’d like to know something about contact lenses.
"Oh, I see. We have both hard and soft contact lenses. They are very popular, but a little more expensive than ordinary glasses."
As a student, it's better for me to wear ordinary glasses instead of contact lenses.
We have many kinds of glasses here. Which frames do you like best?
"I think the square-shaped ones will be the best for me. "
"What about this pair? They are the'in'things now in optical wear. Try them on."
"They fit me very well. I like them."
Jane: How about going to dance this evening, Jane? You will find that the night life of this city is very interesting!
There is a good nightclub nearby, isn't it?
Yes, the dance hall is nice with various styles of music.
" ( In the club ) Look at those people in the dance floor, they are so crazy. "
"That's rock and roll with fast tempo."
I like the slow dance. I am good at rumba and waltz.
The time for slow dance is the middle part of the party.
"Let's find a quiet seat and sit down for beverage."
"OK, follow me."
Listen, it is waltz. I like the elegant step of the old styles.
May I help you?
"Sure..."
"Welcome to Adventure Tours. May I help you?"
I want to book a tour with adventure sports.
Our company has more than ten years of experience in the adventure tourism and sports field. Let me show you some options.
I don 't really think I'm ready to throw myself down a river full of jagged rocks in a rubber boat or go up in the air in a wicker basket held up by an oversize balloon. What else do you have?
"Well, in that case, we can take you hang gliding with one of our experienced instructors. It ’s the closest you can get to flying."
"What? You mean strap myself to a flimsy kite?"
Mmm. OK. Well, why don 't you tell me a little bit more about what you would like? We have everything from mountain biking, to rock climbing to street luge.
" I'm thinking something exciting but safer. "
"I have the perfect option, this package will take you on a hiking trip through the Himalayas for three days and afterwards there's a dog sledding journey!"
None of the above choices.
I'm not sure.
"What about going to a movie?"
"I've got a telegraphic order. Will you cash it?"
"No, I don't have any ID with me."
"Yes, here is my passport."
"What currency will you have?"
US dollars, please.
All right, and how will you have it?
"500 in twenty dollar bills and the rest in a dollar bills."
Here you are.
"Good evening, John. "
Mary: Good evening.
How are you doing?
I'm doing fine, thanks. What's new with you?
"Nothing special. "
I am wondering whether you could come over for a pizza sometime next week.
"Sounds good.Sorry, here comes my bus.You call me, or I'll call you to make a date."
"I'll call you."
" Bye, keep in touch."
Lily : Yes, I can come to the picnic this weekend.
It sounds great. Where are you going?
I think we can go to the river, go around and have supper.
"What should I bring?"
Peter, have you seen my purse?
No, mom. I haven't seen it.
" That's strange. It should be on the desk."
Mom, did you try the basket on your bicycle?
He locked himself in the room.
" I think he was locked in it."
But you can see the key in his hand through the window!
" I really want to make a salad. "
"What kind of salad do you want?"
I'm not sure what kind that I want.
"I usually make a Caesar salad. "
" Those taste really good. "
"I'm going to make a salad"
I want a chicken salad.
" I enjoy chicken salads. "
I like salads with croutons, almonds, and shredded cheese.
" I really like how that sounds. "
None of the above choices.
"Yes, I would like to order now."
